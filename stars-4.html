</h2>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-2">Soon after we moved into the new place — a bungalow with a huge garden — a dog came through the gap in the front hedge one night. My brother gave her some food, she subsequently came back for more, then refused to go away. We called her Doggy. She was my brother’s dog.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-3">Doggy later produced a daughter, whom we called Rover. Rover was attached to my eldest sister, and would sit by the front gate around 1.30 pm when she was expected back from school, facing the direction she’d be coming from.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-4">After Rover died (from a road accident — we lived by a main road), Grandma’s Alsatian, Ah Ham, produced a son, which was given to us as a replacement. My eldest sister called him Boo Bear, after the cartoon character Yogi Bear’s side kick, Boo, whom Yogi Bear would call Boo Boo Boy.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-5">Boo Bear adopted me as his mate. I was about eight.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-6">I used to play wicked tricks on Boo Bear.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-7">I frequently sat in a rattan bucket chair in the covered patio area, playing my harmonica or the small accordion, one leg crossed over the other, foot about eight inches above the ground. Boo Bear would come and sit on the floor in front of me and listen to my performance (sole audience for my solo!), resting his chin on the foot sticking out, eyes closed.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-8">When he was nicely settled in, I’d uncross my legs, thus forcing his chin to lose its comfortable perch and rousing him from his nap. Then I’d cross my legs the other way, so the foot sticking out would now be facing the other direction. Boo Bear would shuffle round to that foot and rest his chin on it, but once he started to doze off, I’d uncross my legs, and start the process all over again.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-9">He was ever so patient, never getting cross with me for disrupting his nap, each time repositioning his bum and chin anew.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-10">My wicked tricks extended to food.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-11">I used to sit in that same bucket chair while eating fruit as well. Boo Bear would immediately appear in front of me, gazing intently into my face. I knew what this meant: he wanted a share of my fruit — any fruit, even orange, except banana.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-12">I’d ignore him, avoiding eye contact. He’d start licking his lips: tongue swish one way. I’d ignore him. Tongue swish the other direction. I’d ignore him. Swish one way, then the other in rapid succession. I’d ignore him. Swish one way, then the other, then swallow visibly hard and audibly loud — GULP! Sometimes more than once to drive his message home. Only then would I part with a piece of my fruit.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-13">There was one odd thing about him, though: he didn’t like banana, yet he’d sit there and go through the whole process when I was eating a banana. I had to tell him eventually, after he’d done all the lip-licking and swallowing hard and loud, “This is banana. You don’t like banana,” break off a piece and hold it right up to his nose for him to smell it. His face was always a sight to behold: he’d look disgusted and crinkle his nose, “Uggh, is that what it is?!? I’ve been wasting my time,” then go away and leave me alone for the rest of my banana. It was odd that he couldn’t smell it until it was right up against his nose.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-14">I’d normally call him Bear Bear, but if I was cross with him, it’d be “Boo!”. He’d instantly look sheepish and contrite, knowing he must’ve done something to bring forth my displeasure, and avoid eye contact.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-15">Bear Bear was equally good at detecting sadness in me.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-16">As the youngest in the family, I was not allowed to remonstrate even if I’d been wrongly accused of something. That’s just the Chinese style of upbringing — in those days anyway, and certainly in my family. You do not argue, you just accept it, it comes with your status (or lack of). The grown-ups are always right, and even if they’re wrong, you do not point this out. (If you do, you now have the new crime of being argumentative and insolent, so you’re still in the wrong! If for a different reason this time.) Face, you know — you do not make the grown-ups lose face.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-17">In one of these situations, I’d go to the back of the house, where the garage was. The garage was just a roof on six pillars over a concrete floor, since this was Singapore with its hot and humid tropical climate. I’d go and sit against one of these pillars, and have a good cry over the injustice.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-18">Bear Bear would suddenly appear at my side, his face lighting up, “Ah, that’s where you are!! I’ve been looking all over the place for you.” Then, his face would go, “Oh, you’re crying,” and his whole body would sober up. He would sit down quietly beside me. I’d put my hand on his shoulder, and start to give him the details: who said what, how unfair they’d been to accuse me of this and that, not giving me a chance to answer back and clear my name. All this time, he’d wear a sombre look and his eyes would say, “Yes, yes, I understand, that’s so unfair, isn’t it? Poor you. I sympathise.” He’d lick my hand or face as further proof of his support.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-19">When I’d got it all off my chest, my mood would lift, and Bear Bear would immediately twig: he’d get up, almost hopping on the spot, with his face and eyes lighting up, “OK, can we go and play now!? Can we, can we?!?”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-20">Because of his sensitivity to my body language, poor Bear Bear would also fall prey to the trick I played on him every time I wanted to give him a wash.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-21">Singapore used to import a high proportion of its water from Malaysia — still does, but a smaller amount now (we used to have three reservoirs, now 15) — with every drop metered. To collect rainwater, my father had built a water butt out of concrete rings, with a diameter of six feet and each about a foot in height, piled up to seven or eight rings high to reach the gutter. (The same concrete rings he’d used to build the crocodile nursery, using just three rings.) This water would be used for the plants, and for cleaning the car, the drains, the floor — and the dog (plus the cat on the one disastrous occasion — see also <em class="emphasis">Giving the cat a bath</em>).</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-22">If Bear Bear knew I was going to give him a wash, he’d dig his heels in after I’d put the chain around his neck, so that I’d have to tug and pull, scold and cajole: “Come on! This will be good for you. You’ll like it. You’ll be nice and clean. It won’t take long.” This stalemate would often go on for ages.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-23">The quicker way was for me to sneak up on him when his head was turned, slip the chain around his neck ever so quickly, then assume a bubbly body language, “Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!” and start to run. He’d think it was some kind of game, and get quite excited, and start to follow me.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-24">Trot trot trot, a few yards round the corner, screech to a halt by the water butt, chain firmly wound round the tap, and poor Bear Bear would discover there was no game after all. Every single time, every single week, he’d fall for it. Such a trusting chap.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-25">He was very good with me, though: he accepted defeat each time, and would stand there obediently, surrendering to his fate.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-26">On my part, I must say in my own defence, especially after the dirty trick business, I was very good with him, too, during the wash.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-27">I’d wet him and say in an enthusiastic voice, “There! Isn’t that nice! So N-I-C-E and C-O-O-L in this heat! See? I knew you’d like it!”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-28">I’d soap him and say, “Doesn’t this soap smell NICE! All that body grease and dirt collected over the week — you don’t want to be walking around with that, do you?”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-29">I’d scrub him and say, “There! Your own personal massage! Gets the circulation going. Nobody else gets this treatment, you know. You’re so lucky!”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-30">When I was rinsing him, I’d say, “Look at you, all nice and C-L-E-A-N, smelling S-O-O-O good! And you’ve been such a G-O-O-D boy!”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-31">Then I’d undo the chain, “You’re all done!! See? Didn’t take much time, did it? Now you’re FREE!”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-32">He’d rush off to the lawn, shake off all the excess water, and tear around the garden, with me chasing him as a nod in the direction of the game he’d initially thought I was going to play with him. So, all ended well.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-33">As an Alsatian, it was in Bear Bear’s blood to be fierce and fearsome. (Almost 60 years on, it’s suddenly struck me that the sound “boo”, in the S.E. Chinese dialects of 潮州 / Cháozhōu / Teochew and 福建 / Fújiàn / Hokkien, can be 武 (wǔ in Mandarin), meaning “military, valiant, fierce”. It is the same wǔ as in wǔshù 武術 / martial arts. So it was a very appropriate name after all, serendipitously.)</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-34">Being fierce and fearsome meant guarding the house against intruders.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-35">Even if those “intruders” were just little old ladies and young children walking past the house.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-36">Or the Malay postman (a genetically-built-in-target for dogs) on his bicycle.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-37">Or the Indian man delivering bread on his bicycle, tiered box on the rear rack for the loaves.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-38">Or the Chinese man selling soya sauces and sesame oil, on one of those pedal-bike arrangements with a cart in front for the kegs — like a bicycle trailer but in front. He would call out “s-ě-ě yáo” (Cantonese for “soya sauce”) as he cycled along, so that we’d know he was coming.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-39">To his credit, Bear Bear was not racist. Ageist, elitist, snobbish, maybe — but not racist. He’d have a go at them, whatever their skin colour.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-40">Our house did have a gate, but it wasn’t always properly latched. Bear Bear would somehow hear these delivery men, even if he was at the back of the house. Off he would charge to the front gate, and if the latch wasn’t on, he’d get out like a shot.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-41">The images are still fresh in my mind to this day, nearly 60 years later. It would be funny were it not for the consequences.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-42">The Malay postman frantically trying to pedal away with one foot (a skill he obviously hadn’t quite mastered, and which all postmen need to, I feel), the other foot trying to ward off the dog that was charging up to him, teeth bared. Sometimes, the poor man’s hand would still be in the letter box slot, in the midst of pushing the letters through.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-43">The Indian man nervously trying to stop the dog from getting too close to him, instinctively holding out the loaf of bread in front of him as a shield. Many a time, we’d end up with a half-bitten-off loaf delivered, or a loaf abandoned altogether, just sitting on the ground as the poor man made his escape. (As we lived by a main road, you can imagine the sight that greeted the drivers, passengers and pedestrians: a loaf of bread sitting by itself in the road, causing the vehicular and human traffic to wend its way around it until I went to pick it up off the tarmac.) After a few more times of this, the man would stand on the other side of the road and ring his bicycle bell, so I had to cross the road and collect the bread myself.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-44">The Chinese soya sauce and sesame oil man — in a Chinese-style cotton garment (Chinese collar, Chinese cloth buttons) and a large pointed-top palm-leaf hat (the type one sees on rice field workers, especially in Vietnam) — instinctively using his conical hat to try and block the progression of the dog’s teeth, and getting a chunk of the tip bitten off. (Might’ve been his fingers…) After a few repeats, that man never stopped outside our house again. He’d actually pedal faster as he approached our gate, so we had to run down the road after him if we spotted him. Or, if he had managed to sneak past our house altogether, go and get our soya sauce and sesame oil from the shop.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-45">Other attacks were a bit more serious: often a young child, aged four or five, thus about the right height for a dog to bite in the face; an old person, often too doddery to run away or thrust some form of barrier in the path of the suddenly advancing dog. These were the ones who were actually bitten, which meant our not only apologising profusely (as we had to do with those delivery men) but also giving them money to go for a tetanus jab, just in case. Nowadays (or in some litigious country), we’d have been sued many times over.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-46">After each biting, my mother — and Uncle Kim, her brother, if he happened to be visiting — would tie Bear Bear to a pillar, and beat him, berating him at the same time, “You stupid dog! Do you know how much you’re costing us!” Whack, shout, whack, shout.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-47">As the youngest member at home, and being only 12, I was not in a position to challenge their authority, so I had to stand aside, witnessing poor Bear Bear being beaten on each occasion, fighting back the tears, almost unable to watch any of it. I felt the pain as if I’d been at the receiving end myself.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-48">After each beating, I would go and sit with him, still chained to the pillar, putting my arms around his neck, crying and stroking him to comfort him and ease some of the physical and emotional pain and humiliation of being beaten and shouted at. “Why do you keep doing this? Don’t you know that you’re the one to suffer in the end? Why haven’t you learned after all these beatings? Don’t do it again. For your own sake.”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-49">Bear Bear did actually eventually learn, but his pride and reputation as a guard dog had to be preserved and maintained (which was why he did all that in the first place), so he came up with a compromise: he would charge up to the “intruder”, growling or barking, teeth bared, but stop short of actually making contact with the flesh. This meant he could do his duty of menacing the “intruder” without incurring a financial loss to his owner. Each time, I’d tell him how proud I was of him, “Well done! You see? No beating, no shouting at you. You can learn, and you do learn. Well done, Bear Bear. Clever boy.”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-50">This extra level of intelligence and logical mental processing in Bear Bear was also manifested in the sessions for getting rid of the lice and fleas.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-51">I’d chain him to a pillar of the covered patio, sit down on a stool beside him with a comb, a pair of tweezers and a jar of paraffin, and get to work.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-52">They tended to team up — parasite in every sense: not just parasitising on the host (the dog in this case) but parasitising on each other as well (one opening up the hole in the skin, the other jumping on the bandwagon and exploiting this initial effort). A fattened, full-up louse, all grey and waxy — the size of a ladybird, and actually looking like a ladybird in shape as well, but plump and soft, unlike a ladybird’s (seemingly) hard outer covering. Next to it, a scrawny and much smaller flea, browny-red and spider-like with its legs. By cosying up to each other, they saved me work, as I could pluck them out as a pair and drop them into the paraffin. Two bloodsuckers with one tweezer move.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-53">The plucking was not painless for Bear Bear, as the pests had their teeth sunk quite firmly into his flesh, so he’d flinch each time, and try to get away. Being chained to the pillar, however, he could only shift a few inches away from me. I’d then move my little bamboo stool a few inches towards him, and start plucking again.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-54">This series of manoeuvres — him shuffling away (albeit by only a few inches), me moving up to him, him shuffling away, me moving up to him — would end up with him going round and round the pillar, shortening the chain until eventually he couldn’t go anywhere. Except in reverse — but then I was blocking his path back. So that was it. The poor chap had to sit out the rest of the plucking with no escape, not even by a few inches nor for a few more seconds. He never got angry or impatient with me, though, for inflicting this discomfort on him, such was his trust in me — he just went along with it because it was me (see later for more examples of this unconditional trust in me).</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-55">After a number of times of this — which didn’t bother me at all actually, even if it meant I couldn’t do the plucking sitting still in one long session — I decided to try explaining to him what I was doing.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-56">I showed him the plucked-out offenders, gripped between the ends of the tweezers, “You see these things? These nasty things are biting into your flesh. They are sucking out your blood. They are living off you. Your itching and scratching is all due to them. I know the plucking is a bit unpleasant, but it’s all for your good, so if you’ll just put up with it, you’ll feel better once I’ve got rid of them for you. You’ll be itch-free and scratch-free once I’m done. Be patient and bear with me. I’m doing this for your good.”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-57">Bear Bear bared his teeth at the nasties, apparently understanding everything I’d said. After that, no more shifting to get away from me. No more “chasing” him round the pillar until the chain couldn’t be shortened any further. He remembered too, for future sessions down the line. What a clever dog he was.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-58">Both the post-beating talk and the tick-/louse-plucking explanation, and their subsequent results, just go to show the level of intelligence Bear Bear possessed.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-59">One cold and rainy morning, I was woken up by someone in the family pushing me roughly, “Get up, get up! Boo Bear’s been hurt! Go and see him!”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-60">I found him sitting on the verandah, trembling. When I got closer, I saw what he was trembling from: the pain and the shock. It was obvious he’d just been in a fight somewhere — one eye had been scratched out. I also started to tremble from the shock of the sight of this, and could almost feel the pain myself as well.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-61">As a teenager and not having ever come across anything like that before, I just didn’t know what to do.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-62">In those days, we didn’t use vets for our animals. We just let them be: live the lives they were meant to live. Dogs were there to guard the house, cats were there to catch mice. They ate whatever leftover food we humans gave them — maybe a special treat now and then if we had more or surplus food (e.g., extra fish from the wholesale fishery market my father worked at). They slept on the covered patio floor, without a basket or a box — that was all right, in Singapore’s hot tropical climate. If they felt unwell, they just went out to the garden, ate some grass, coughed up the poison, and got well of their own accord. If they died, we buried them in the garden.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-63">Now in hindsight, as an adult, I wish I’d thought of bringing out a blanket to throw over him, if only to keep him warm from the cold and rainy morning, and the shock.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-64">I went to sit with him, stroking his head and body, “Oh, Bear Bear! How did this happen? What happened? Have you been in a fight? You poor thing. Oh, Bear Bear! You poor thing.” I cried and cried — I’m crying now as I’m writing this. Even when my hand went anywhere near his injured eye, he never once flinched. He totally trusted me not to hurt him, even if accidentally.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-65">After a few weeks, the dislocated eye shrivelled up and dropped off, leaving an empty socket.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-66">One day, someone spotted that the empty eye socket had maggots.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-67">My mother’s sister, San Yee (“Third Auntie”), being a nurse (and a grown-up), undertook to clean it up, with one of my sisters (being an older teenager) in attendance, in case she needed a hand — with holding the dog still or something. I was too squeamish to even watch from the side, so I stood some distance away.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-68">A few minutes later, they called me over. Bear Bear wouldn’t let them get near that eye. He was growling and baring his teeth at them, trying to shift away, and even turning his head away whenever San Yee approached with the tweezers.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-69">So, I went to him, “I know it’s not nice, and you must be worried about them putting a pair of tweezers near that eye, but it’s for your good. There are some nasties in there, some maggots, and they’ll be eating away your eye cavity if we don’t remove them. We just need to get rid of them, wash out the eye with some disinfectant, then the maggots will be gone for ever. We’re doing this for your good. Be a good boy.”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-70">Again, he understood what I said, and sat still throughout the maggot-removing session — I was with him, with my hands on his body, but my eyes were averted, so squeamish was I about such things. He kept still right to the end, which again shows the amazing level of intelligence (and trust in me) he had. After that cleaning-up exercise, the eye socket never had any more trouble.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-71">(Now, once again in hindsight as I’m writing this in my late 60s, I realise that the maggots might actually be good for his injured eye cavity. Google says: Quote Larvae therapy involves applying maggots to a wound to help it heal. Maggots can be used to treat dirty or infected wounds as they remove dead tissue and bacteria (germs), leaving behind healthy tissue that can heal. The maggots used in this treatment are specially bred and are sterile so they cannot cause infection. Unquote)</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-72">We never took our dog or cat with us when we went anywhere in the car, not even to Grandma’s coconut plantation where there was plenty of room for them to run around and explore — actually, maybe precisely because of this, as they’d get lost. It just wasn’t the cultural practice of the time. Dogs were there to guard the house, not to be taken out on a car ride.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-73">Bear Bear’s first car journey, unfortunately, was for a sad reason. He’d become old, and we noticed he wasn’t eating properly, not just more slowly. He was also slower in his movements, of course.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-74">One day, after he’d had a hacking cough for a few days, my mother and sister decided to take him to the vet downtown. So, somehow, they managed to find out about a vet — that was how much they thought of him.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-75">Again, as I was the youngest, it wasn’t something for me to be a part of. Nasty things were for the grown-ups to deal with: burying the dog or cat; cleaning up after a new puppy or kitten had messed the floor.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-76">After a few minutes, my sister came back to the house and asked me to go lend a hand.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-77">Bear Bear had refused to get into the car. I thought, “Perhaps it’s because he’d never been in a car before, he doesn’t know what to do — it is strange territory to him.”</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-78">They’d tried to push him into the car from behind — no. They tried pulling him in from inside the car — no. They tried coaxing him, “Come, Bear Bear, come. Get in.” No.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-79">When I turned up, I simply climbed onto the back seat, moved inside a little bit to make some room near the door, and patted the empty space by me. Bear Bear immediately jumped in and sat next to me. I kept my arms around him for the whole journey into town.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-80">Squeamish though I am about such things, I went into the treatment room with Bear Bear, to help him cope with the unfamiliar surroundings and the unknown man (the vet). Even though he was shaking, partly because he was unwell, and partly because he was scared of the strange surroundings, Bear Bear bravely put up with being handled by this stranger, who was pushing a thermometer up his backside, and sticking a needle into his flank. I think it was all because I was there by his side, comforting and reassuring him. And he trusted me.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-81">A couple of days later, I found Bear Bear lying on the floor next to his food bowl, a lump of food by his mouth. It looked like he’d choked on this lump of food, although he did manage to find the strength to cough it up. (Once again, in hindsight, we should’ve thought of cutting up his food into tiny pieces.) The effort of coughing up that lump of food must’ve been too much for him.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-82">Nearly sixty years on, I still often think about this dear four-legged playmate and soulmate of mine, who saw me through my teens. I still shed a tear — quite a few, actually. I still miss him.</div>
<div class="para" id="stars-4-83">I never came across another dog as intelligent or as sensitive as Boo Bear the Alsatian.</div>
