<div class="para" id="p-216">The Highwood Road house had a garden at the back.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-217">I’d get home from work, change straight out of my outdoor clothes into old gardening gear, and go and do some weeding in the garden until it got dark.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-218">The path from the kitchen door to the garden was lined with cherry trees. The trunks were about 4 inches (10 cms) in diameter.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-219">After the first day, a stocky black and white cat with a docked tail (or he was a Manx cat) would come and join me in my weeding, staying around me throughout, sitting somewhere close by. Housemate Sheila later told me he was next door’s cat Basil — she’d heard them calling him.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-220">The window of my half-landing rear bedroom overlooked the roof of the kitchen extension. I’d leave it open in the warm weather. Basil found his way into my room one evening, by climbing onto the kitchen roof, then up onto my window sill. He’d come every night and sleep in my bed.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-221">One day, I was walking down the garden path to go and do some weeding when I saw Basil sitting behind one of the cherry trees. His head was hidden by the tree trunk, but the rest of his body stuck out.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-222">I’d thought initially that he was just sitting there, daydreaming and minding his own business, but when I got closer to the tree, Basil suddenly stepped out into the path, stood up on his hind legs, raised his upper legs into the air (like someone surrendering), mouth wide open, in a silent “BOO!” gesture. So, he was hiding behind the tree, lying in wait for me!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-223">It obviously didn’t occur to him that the tree trunk was too narrow to hide the rest of his body. He must’ve thought, just because he couldn’t see me (with his head, and therefore eyes too, behind the tree trunk), that I couldn’t see him either. Haha.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-224">PS: Having written this blog, it occurred to me that people in this country don’t tend to dock the tails of dogs and cats (unlike in Singapore during my childhood when it was done), so Basil must be a Manx cat. Googling the traits of Manx cats produces “playful” for one of them!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-225">(London, UK, 1983)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-226">From googling: QUOTE. The Manx is considered a social and gregarious cat, and very attached to humans, but also shy of strangers. The breed is said to be highly intelligent, playful, and in its behaviour reminiscent of dogs. For example, like some Maine Coons and a few other breeds, Manx cats often learn to fetch small thrown objects. They may also follow their owners about like puppies, and are believed to be better able to learn simple verbal commands than most cats. …temperament …“quaint and interesting” … “docile, good-tempered and sociable” UNQUOTE</div></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-5"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<div class="para" id="p-227">Ben, two years below me at SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London), threw a dinner party at his flat in north London. There were about six or eight of us, including his brothers Lloyd and Adam.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-228">It was my first acquaintance with venison — tasted a bit like beef in texture and flavour, maybe because it was done the Chinese 紅燒 hóngshāo style (dark soya sauce), which is a common Chinese way of cooking beef.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-229">In typical university-student fashion, we stayed up until way past midnight, drinking and jaw-jawing. Then, too late for public transport, we camped down on the living room floor, aligned like sardines. That was very common in those days — the 70s.</div>

<div class="para" id="p-243">A friend, Daniel, bought a house in north London from a lady who then moved a few streets away.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-244">Her cat — a pale stripy tom that looks like a discoloured zebra — refuses to accept that they have now moved and keeps coming back to his old home, blatantly lying around in the open patio just outside the kitchen, or in the covered patio at the bottom of the garden, or just about anywhere he cares to occupy proprietorially, as if it was still his territory.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-245">If he is shooed away, he’ll move only just out of striking distance, e.g., from the kitchen patio area to the back patio. If Daniel keeps up the chasing, he’ll move out of the garden only as far as just the other side of the back fence, then sit on the roof of that neighbour’s garden shed, and vociferously and plaintively rail at Daniel about the injustice of being ousted from what he perceives to be his rightful turf.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-246">He can easily out-meow you — cat food manufacturers should cash in on his energy levels and approach his mistress about getting him to star in their adverts for their products.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-247">I was witness, on one occasion, to Daniel chasing him out of the back patio area and his fully answering back from the top of the neighbour’s garden shed.</div>

</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-252">(This first appeared as a journal entry, then a blog.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-253">Jean-Louis is the neighbour who lives one kilometre from the French farm, down by the main road — the A21 that runs south to the Pyrénées.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-254">He comes up quite regularly to deliver pain (bread) when it’s his turn, as he and Jeanette alternate their pain-buying trips, which is very ecological and economical. (Haha, if this was in Britain, I could do another alliteration trick by calling it “saving petrol, pounds and pollution”!)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-255">Colette told me before this winter trip of mine that the frisky black cat (mentioned in Purrfect pals) has taken a particular fancy to him, jumping into his arms the moment he arrives and rubbing herself feverishly against the big man’s big beard. Without meaning to undermine Jean-Louis’s attraction for the furry inhabitants on the farm, I suggested to Colette that the black cat might’ve been nuzzling up to his generously hirsute face for its usefulness as a de-fleaing device.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-256">One day, I came back in to the farm house from working outside to find Jean-Louis had arrived but the black cat was not in his arms as usual but on the sofa. A closer inspection of his face disclosed the fact that he’d had a shave, which would prove my theory right about her using his face for de-fleaing.</div>

<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">3.3.6</span> <span class="title">Jiang the Afghan cat</span>
</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-259">Jiang 薑, which means “ginger” in Chinese, is so named because of his colouring. Not “ginger” in the Western red hair colour sense, but root ginger, the common ingredient in Chinese cooking.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-260">His owners, Irish David and English Jane, had done a degree in Chinese.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-261">Jiang is a long lean cat. His fur is speckled with various shades of brown. His tail is a gorgeous series of rings of darker and paler brown, like a lemur’s tail.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-262">I was visiting David and Jane one day, standing at their front door after having rung the bell, when I suddenly looked up and spotted Jiang sitting on the external sill of the first floor window, looking to the distance like he was day-dreaming. I called out to him, “Jiang!” He turned round, immediately answered back, and actually started to walk along the eaves over the ground floor (which is rather precarious) to come over to me. He did reach me, jumping down from the first floor.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-263">A while later, David asked me to go over and stay overnight a few times a week during the three weeks he and Jane were going away to Botswana. A neighbour would come round and put down food and water, he said, but they felt that Jiang needed company. The last time they went away for three weeks, Jiang wouldn’t leave them alone after they got back: he stuck to their heels wherever they went in the house, refusing to let them out of his sight, as if afraid of being abandoned.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-264">As an evening teacher, with post-lesson pubbing sessions with my mature students after classes at nine o’clock, I would only arrive at David and Jane’s house around 11.30 pm. Feeling that I couldn’t just go straight to bed, I’d switch on the TV, sit on the floor, leaning back at a 60-degree angle against the front of the sofa, almost in a horizontal position. Jiang would come and sit on my chest, stretching out his long body over my front, his hind legs down my upper legs to just above my knees, and his head below my chin, paws wrapped around my neck. He’d then go to sleep happily in this position, leaving me unable to move until my legs went numb and I had to shift, or I had to go to bed.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-265">It was just before the cat-sitting stint that I got an attack of bad back. My lower back suddenly simply gave way one day as I was walking down the road — without my usual rucksack, ironically. I felt a sharp twinge, and couldn’t stand up straight after that. I tried all sorts of things: stretching, massaging my back with a tennis ball, using the hand-held massaging rod from China.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-266">A Japanese colleague gave me some heat pads, each individually packed and sealed. The moment you open the pack, the contents, which feel like crushed up lava or porous gravel, will start to get hot upon exposure to air, lasting some ten hours. You slap one on the affected area, held down with some tape.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-267">I’d open one of these heat pads at bedtime at David and Jane’s, so that I could sleep pain-free. It was winter at the time. Jiang was normally not allowed in the bedrooms, but I decided to let him sleep in my bed for a prolonged duration of human contact, since he was left alone all day.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-268">Part-way through the night, I was woken up by this feeling of a huge weight on my right hip — I’d been lying on my left side. It turned out to be Jiang perched on my hip, as that was the spot nearest my lower back, where the heat pad was. Cats are so good at finding heat sources, aren’t they? (See also Four-legged heat radar.) One always knows when a car’s just come back/parked — from the cat sitting on its bonnet.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-269">I left Jiang there for a bit longer, not wanting to disturb him in his sleep, so I was locked into that position for a while.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-270">Then, I had to change position, so I picked him up, moved him off my right hip, and turned the other way. Back he’d climb onto the other (left) hip, and stay there until I had to change position again.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-271">At one point, I changed position to lie on my back, so Jiang lost his perch on my hip. Undeterred, he then snuggled right up against my side.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-272">This position shifting for me, and for ;the cat accordingly, went on every hour or so throughout the night. (Apparently, we toss and turn 40–50 times a night in our sleep.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-273">After David and Jane got back, they reported that there was an improvement in Jiang: he was not as clinging as before when they got back from their previous holiday. My back, however, had not improved in spite of those heat pads… Maybe because it had to carry the weight of a long lean cat perched on top, not daring to move for fear of disrupting the cat’s slumber.</div>

</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-275">(This first appeared as a journal entry, then a blog.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-276">For some reason, the cats on the French farm are not assigned any names. And have never been, I think.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-277">The dogs are called Pastou, Fleurie, Mizou and so on. (Dino  came already named Dino by his previous, now deceased, owner — see also <em class="emphasis">Dino the dirty dog</em>.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-278">The cats, however, are all simply addressed as Mimi (see also Minou), even when spoken to directly and singly.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-279">(This reminds me of my own family’s tradition of treating the dog and the cat differently: speaking English to the dog and Mandarin to the cat.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-280">The frisky one (little black cat — see also Jean-Louis and the little black cat) will totally disrupt your reading or journal-writing, endlessly nudging your fingers, hands and any other part of your body that he can mark you with.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-281">By “mark”, I mean mainly scent but he also leaves scratch marks when he jumps on or all over you, as well as (playful but painful) bite marks when he suddenly takes a fancy to your finger.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-282">As soon as the one with tiger stripes spots you (haha, pun! stripes and spots), he will instantly claim your lap — or even chest if you’re sitting a bit reclined (as in a sun-lounger) — and go to sleep, freezing you in the one pose until your legs go numb. If you move him to de-numb your legs, he will instantly climb back on. (See also <em class="emphasis">Jiang the Afghan cat</em>.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-283">If you’ve got something on your lap (e.g., dry haricot bean pods to shell), Tiger (my name for him) will sit on the bit of sun-lounger beside or behind you, basically staying close throughout even though you’re too busy to stroke or cuddle him.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-284">If you leave the sun-lounger, so will he, which proves that he’s not there for the sun-lounger but for your company. One feels honoured to be adopted by cats in this way, as the Swiss ex-boyfriend used to say. (He had also called them “whores”, though, sucking up to anyone who will dish out the stroking and cuddling.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-285">Mummy Cat (as I call the variegated one with a series of successive broods, poor old girl) will try to get to your face for her to nuzzle, by climbing up your leg — or arm, if you bend down, say, to pull up some weeds — with her front legs. Sweet, but rather painful. She has this lovely touch of putting her paws on your shoulders, one on each side, then wrapping them round your neck in a big hug while she nuzzles your chin or cheek.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-286">If you’re standing at a table, she’ll jump onto the table to try and get to you from that level. If you stand back, she’ll try and reach out, sometimes to the point of nearly falling off the table, in which case she’ll even keep three legs on the table and just use one to try and climb up your arm in her eagerness to get to your face for that nuzzle. Affectionate or demanding?</div>
<div class="para" id="p-287">Practically all the cats are highly responsive and interactive, although in different ways. Each looks different (in colour combinations and patterns) and each has his/her own very individualistic mannerisms and way of communicating with you. As I got to know each one, I found myself saying to them in turn every day — often more than once a day: “I wish I could take you back to London with me.” I can see why Serge and Jeanette have them around, even though it means extra work and cost, because they fill one’s life with so much affection.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-288">The beige one (and mother of the black frisky one — they are both the same size and I’d mistaken them to be siblings) was the first to “adopt” me by greeting me from inside the bushy plant-climber cage by the front door before I’d even spotted her having a kip in there.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-289">After the first few days of my arrival, she took to sleeping in my bed, then in my open suitcase among my clothes, and finally on it when I shut the lid to keep her out. She’d get to my room on the first floor by scaling the ground floor wooden shutters and then the stretch of wall between the shutters on the two storeys, thus endangering her nine lives.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-290">The black canvas material of the suitcase was liberally covered with her pale hairs by the last day of my stay, but when Mauricette (visiting for a week with husband Simon) offered to brush them off, I said no, I wanted to keep it as it was — as a souvenir, to keep the memory of these purrfect pals alive and fresh.</div>

<div class="para" id="p-292">(See also Purrfect pals.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-293">The first time I met Tiger was through the kitchen window of the French farm house.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-294">I was working at the kitchen sink. On the window sill sat a large stripy cat, looking in. Like the rest of the cats on the farm, he didn’t have a name. Farm mistress Jeanette called him a monster.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-295">Any leftovers or rejects (such as bones) from the preparation of the meal or the dining table would be taken out through the kitchen garden door for the six dogs and six cats. Tiger would leave his window sill spot, run round to the kitchen door and muscle in.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-296">I didn’t like this bully boy behaviour, especially given his size, and would try and ward him off, using one hand to push him out of the way, so that the smaller cats could have their share of the food first.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-297">This happened almost every time. I began to worry that Tiger might start to resent me, maybe even scratch or bite me in his eagerness to get to the food.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-298">To make up for this unfair treatment, I’d sometimes give him priority by calling out to him when I had some treat to dole out. Amazingly, he recognised my name for him although he’d never been called that before (the cats on the farm are not given names — see also Minou), and would leave his window sill perch and come running round from the back of the farmhouse.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-299">(The main diet of the dogs and cats on the farm were fed mainly stale baguette — from the bakery in the nearest village, in exchange for various produce from the farm: eggs, for example. It’d be soaked in water and lard, so anything outside of that is a treat, even kitchen scraps which are rejects from humans. I can’t help being reminded of the human situation with some countries being so picky about their food and others not even getting the bare minimum…. Or some humans in the same country even.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-300">It must’ve been this act of kindness on my part that warmed him to me. (Although I must say that all the cats on the farm are incredibly affectionate, and forgiving of any rough treatment. Ditto the dogs.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-301">Here are excerpts from my journal:</div>
<div class="para" id="p-302">Monday 260911: The tiger cat went to the rabbit area looking for me when I went to feed them some greens around 6 pm, calling out calling out until I established eye contact with him through a gap in the corral door, then sat down in a depression under a little tree to wait for me to finish before following me back to the patio area.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-303">Tuesday 270911: Tiger [came over to the sun lounger and] claimed my lap the moment I sat down although he was in the undergrowth by the downstairs bedroom (next to the kitchen), which is almost 10 ft away, so it’s definitely a conscious and deliberate effort/initiative on his part. He’s now grooming himself. Earlier I had the black/grey/white cat (the one that crosses its front paws). Tiger followed me, like the beige cat before, on my snail-collecting trip, and like the beige cat kept trying to nudge my hand as soon as I lowered it to pick up some snails. After some sharp-toned discouragement, aided by my hand pushing him away, the message got home and he sat to one side waiting. Fast learner, but also very forgiving for he’s still friends with me.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-304">021011: Tiger [was] happy to lie by or behind me on the sun recliner when I couldn’t have him on my lap as I was shelling the haricot. He seems genuinely happy to see, and be with, me: even when I call him over from the kitchen ledge — his usual spot — for a plate to lick, he’d just nuzzle my ankles without noticing the plate in my hand.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-305">…</div>
<div class="para" id="p-306">Tiger has been trying to stay close to me, bless him. Whenever I left the kitchen door open, he would come in to be with me, at the risk of being shoo’ed out by Jeanette. I then had to entice him out by walking out of the kitchen to the side garden, which would make him follow me, and run back in quickly after walking out far enough, and shutting the kitchen door on him, which makes me feel mean.</div>
