  "body": " Introduction  This collection started off as a couple of exotic but true tales during the post-lesson pubbing sessions with my evening class students: about growing up in Singapore with crocodiles and a monkey at home, among other things. Not a childhood (nor a Singapore, for that matter) to be found these days.  Most of the other stories are from my own experience during annual visits to the French farm north of the Pyrénées, an unique place for the eccentric inhabitants, both two- and four-legged.  They have given me so much joy in recollection that I thought I should record the stories to share with animal lovers, before my memory goes on strike in my old age.  Apart from the three stars of the show, it’s hard to choose how to present the rest, so, to be fair to them, I've gone for animal categories in alphabetical order.  (Some of the stories first appeared as journal entries in situ, then as blogs. Changes have been made wherever necessary for the needs of publishing them.)  "

  "title": "Tears for the crocodiles",
  "body": " Tears for the crocodiles  I came home from school one day, aged nine, to find that the baby crocodiles had arrived.  Father had been busy the past few weeks in the front garden, building some kind of structure designed by himself.  He was perpetually doing that, gripped by a sudden burst of inspiration and energy: “This will make a lot of money. Just you wait!”  He’d sit down and draw up plans and designs, then go out and return with the material, often making a number of trips. You’d then find one corner of the garden taken over, with all the bits spread around, messing the place up for weeks and weeks, if not months, which would invariably set my mother off.  At the dinner table, he’d make a fuss about how much weight he’d lost, holding out his waistband to prove his point.  Nobody took much notice of him, as these eccentric projects of his didn’t usually come to much, if anything at all.  So! The structure he’d been working on the last few weeks turned out to be a home for crocodiles!  That was the permanent one for the adults. Permanent until they left us, that is.  There was another one for the babies, only for until they were transferred to the grown-up enclosure.  The crocodile nursery was made of three concrete rings, with a diameter of six feet, each about a foot tall, piled up to make a high-enough enclosure so that the baby crocs could not escape. The bottom was filled with about three inches of water, for them to immerse themselves in for cooling off from the tropical heat. We also left small boulders and bricks dotted about for them to perch on, should they get fed up of being in the water.  The babies were about two feet long: 10 inches for the body, 5 inches for the snout, and 9 inches for the tail. They grew to about 5 feet long, or more.  To feed them, we used the fine, flexible end of the main vein of coconut leaves to thread through the sprat, then, holding the thick end, lowered it and dangled it near their mouth. Quick as a flash, they’d snatch it, sometimes so roughly that they’d end up snapping off the thin skewer, still stuck in the fish.  Crocodiles wolf down their food whole but, having no tongue, they cannot move the food around in their mouth if the fish is facing the wrong way. If they pick up the fish with the tail facing the throat, they will not swallow it, as the jagged end is too jarring. If that happens, they will open their mouth, and toss the fish between the upper and lower jaws to rotate it — up and down, up and down, over and over again, until the head is facing the throat. Then they will swallow it.  It takes a bit of practice not to toss the fish too vigorously, as it might fall out, which they learn ultimately to get right. That, or go hungry.  If the fish falls out during the tossing, they’ll have to start all over again, turning their head sideways to grasp it between their jaws. They might then fail to re-grab the fish, or drop it yet again after re-grabbing, which will take them back to Step 1 of the chain of feeding, so they could be there all day, just trying to eat one little sprat (4”–5” long), poor things.  The enclosure for the adults was a 15’x5’ concrete oblong, surrounded by brick walls about 3’ high. It looks like one of those contraptions placed over a bath, for holding the soap, shampoo and back scrubber — called a bath (caddy) rack: dipping in the middle (for the wet-pond section), rising up gently to level areas at each end (for the dry-land sections).  A tap was installed on the inside of one wall, for refilling the pond. In the middle of one of the long-sided pond walls, at the base, was a hole, for draining off the dirty water when we cleaned out the pond, then bunged (on the outside!) for filling up the pond with clean water.  The pond section was covered over with a wooden frame: a slatted structure with wire netting, over which we placed about 20 pots of orchids to weigh it down. This hid the fact that there was a crocodile pond within those walls. (We lived by a main road.) It was also to prevent the crocs from escaping, and allow the water for the orchids to drip into the pond.  Orchids have aerial roots, so they are planted not in soil but in brick and charcoal chips in a pot with holes all round. This means that when you water the orchids, the water runs off immediately.  Singapore imports its water from Malaysia — used to be a higher percentage during my childhood days, when we had only three reservoirs (now 15). We all have water meters, so we pay for every single drop of water used.  My family was very big on recycling, especially when it came to water. We’d have a bucket permanently stationed by the kitchen sink. Any used water that was non-greasy, e.g., from washing vegetables or rinsing dishes, would go into the bucket, then carried out to the garden for the plants.  I went a step further in recycling water. I used the water that had defrosted the sprats to soak the pots of orchids. This process was most time-consuming: leave each pot sitting in the fish water for about five minutes (you can see bubbles rising to the surface as the brick and charcoal chips absorb the water), then remove and leave on the lawn, so that the lawn grass benefits from the run-off water. Win, win and win.  The dry-land ends of the crocodile enclosure were hidden under concrete stepped terraces above, upon which we placed more pots of orchids. (We had about 50 pots of orchids in our garden.) The whole thing looked like just an innocent tiered arrangement of potted orchids.  The housework in my family was meant to be roughly divided up into:  the outdoor chores — to be done by the men (my father, brother, the old Malay tukang kebun [gardener]);  the indoor chores — to be done by the women (my mother, two aunts, us four daughters, two female servants).  As a tomboy, I am useless at the girly tasks, so I undertook the men’s jobs: tending to the garden (including mowing thelawn), scrubbing out the drains, washing the car and the dog (plus one disastrous attempt at giving the cat a bath). Feeding the crocodiles and mucking out their pond thus became my duty, which I was happy to take on, because it was meditative.  To clean out the crocodile enclosure, I’d remove the bung (on the outside!) and let the pond water run off. It often took half an hour.  My father’s (not-always-well-thought-out) design had come up with a well (about 1’6” in diameter) the other side of the hole, for the water to flow into, instead of a duct in the ground to lead the dirty water directly to the open drain at the edge of the garden. This lack of foresight meant having to empty the well, bucket by bucket. I have heard or read this saying somewhere that would apply to this situation: “Kitchens are used by women but designed by men.” I treated it all as good exercise, however, and the water scooped out from that well also went to the flowers in the garden, instead of straight down the drain. Further recycling.  When the pond was drained, I’d lean over the side of the enclosure wall, use a long-handled broom to chase the crocs off the dry-land sections down into the emptied pond in the middle, scrub the floor of the dry-land areas, and hose down. Then, I’d use the broom to chase the crocodiles back on to the dry-land sections, so that I could scrub and rinse out the pond. Once this was done, I’d put the bung back in (on the outside!), and turn on the tap inside, to fill the pond.  You might think this was all very boring work. Not a bit. I got loads of fun out of this seemingly monotonous, tedious and mundane physical-labour chore.  On one occasion, while I was scrubbing out the floor of the pond, one of the crocodiles suddenly got curious about what was going on, and decided to leave the dry-land section and venture down to find out, walking straight under the bristles that were going back and forth. Instinctively, I immediately apologised, “Oh, sorry, sorry!” as the bristles were quite thick.  The crocodile, however, absolutely loved it, half shutting its eyes in rapturous enjoyment. Oh, I see! Its hide is so thick that the tough bristles of the broom actually tickled it, rather than hurt it! I ran the bristles over the crocodile one more time. Yes! It’s lowering its eyelids again!  So, I went through this motion again and again, giving it a back scratch. Before long, another crocodile twigged, and started leaving the dry-land area to get its back tickled as well.  Soon, I was busy scrubbing the backs of some five or six crocodiles, all thoroughly enjoying their back scrub, sitting very still, rolling their eyes into their foreheads.  The area most sensitive is between the lower legs, where our human coccyx would be, at the base of the spinal column. If you scratch that part of the croc, it will, along with lowering its eyelids, raise that part of its body, standing on its hind feet, arching its lower back.  On another occasion, as the tap was running, filling the scrubbed-out pond with fresh water, one crocodile discovered this source of tumbling cold water, and went to sit directly underneath, letting the water splash onto its neck. Sheer bliss! Having cold water splashing on one’s neck in the tropical heat! It closed its eyelids in absolute ecstasy. (I could almost see a smile on its face.)  Soon, another crocodile cottoned on to what this first chap was doing, and came over to muscle in on the deliciously cold shower, sitting on top of the first one. Before long, a third crocodile also got the picture, and climbed on top of the second croc. Then, a fourth one on top of the third. The croc pile got too high, and the whole stack toppled.  My father took the occasional turn at feeding, and\/or cleaning out the pond.  His brain was filled with strange ideas, my father. He thought he would train the crocodiles to get used to him — the master. So, during feeding time, he’d whistle a particular tune (made up by himself) as he threw the sprats in. This went on for months on end.  Father was really pleased with himself, “See? They recognise the tune, they know it’s me! They come running when they hear the tune!” I decided not to enlighten him: they’re hungry, it’s feeding time, you’re throwing down the fish as you’re whistling the tune.  One day, my father decided to clean out the pond. Instead of standing on the lawn side of the enclosure wall, safely leaning over the wall to scrub out the floor of the pond, he decided to jump in. After all, the crocs had all been chased up onto the dry-land areas, so they were safely out of the way. Weren’t they?  He then made the mistake of whistling the feeding-time tune as he scrubbed away merrily. My father had obviously never heard about Pavlov’s dog. One of the crocodiles, associating it with food, came down from the dry land, and sank its teeth into my father’s ankle.  With a sharp yelp, my father leapt out of the pond in one swift move. He started beating the crocodile with the broom: “You stupid animal!! Don’t you know I’m your master!?! You don’t go biting your own master!!” (Yes, he had to go to the hospital for a few stitches.)  Another day, Father came home with a tortoise. It was decided that Tick Tock should go in the crocodile enclosure. Maybe for the company. It had a hard shell to hide under, after all. It should be all right.  My eldest sister named it Tick Tock, maybe because they are slow, maybe because of Tick Tock the Crocodile in Peter Pan.  Tick Tock survived for a few years alongside the crocodiles, until one night when he probably got too curious during a crocodile fight and stuck out his head to look. The next day I found his head sitting a few inches away from his shell.  It was ironical that my sister named it Tick Tock, even though our Tick Tock didn’t actually end up in the crocodile’s belly. Maybe the crocs felt guilty — maybe they had an Oops! moment when they discovered that their fighting had ended up in Tick Tock’s decapitation, and that’s why they didn’t eat his head. Perhaps crocs have a conscience too.  One afternoon, I came across a grown-up crocodile lying in the gutter on the edge of our garden some five or six yards from the crocodile enclosure. The drain was the width of its belly (about five inches across), so it fitted snugly. Don’t know how it got there, nor how long it’d been sitting there. Perhaps the heavy rain the night before had raised the water level of the pond in the enclosure, and somehow it managed to escape without upsetting the frame enough to make it obvious.  I raised the alarm, and a few helpers were scrambled. We got a sack to throw over its head, and quickly clamped its jaws together. We then lifted it out of the drain, and put it back into the enclosure.  It had created a bit of a panic at the time, because that smaller open drain in our garden led to a bigger open drain by the main road outside our garden. If the crocodile had not been spotted in time, it might’ve found its way to that bigger drain, and thence to a monsoon storm drain (easily the width of two cars at least for the smaller ones), which would make it impossible to capture, thus posing a danger to the public.  When the crocs were big enough to be sold, my father would persuade his fishery firm colleagues to come round and catch them. Only the skin was sold for turning into expensive handbags and wallets, belts and shoes, so my father would give the meat to the croc catchers.  In the Chinese culture, one doesn’t really pay friends with money for their help. Crocodile meat was not available on the open market, and the Chinese love unusual kinds of food, so it worked perfectly for all parties.  The way our crocodiles were caught was to have two men to do the direct trapping, each armed with a stick and a lasso attached to one end.  They stand at the enclosure wall, and lower the lassoes. Slowly, slowly, one lasso approaches the jaw end of the croc, another lasso the tail end.  The tail end is the trickier bit, because it tends to sit flat on the ground, leaving little room to slip the noose in. The crocodile can also flip its tail sideways in a flash, so that you can lose the lasso-hold that’s taken you ages to gain. The snout end has a bit more room between the lower jaw and the ground for the lasso to slide in.  This lassoing process can take a long time. It certainly requires a lot of patience, not to mention nerves. Don’t forget, these men were not professionals, they were just my father’s fishery firm colleagues, and they only came to do it once a year, if that.  The targeted crocodile has to be isolated. Chasing the rest of the crocodiles up onto the dry land, or away from the targeted one, can be tricky. With a dozen or so crocs in the one enclosure, as soon as you have managed to get some of them out of the pond, onto the dry land, and go back to the pond to chase more of them, the dry-land ones might return to the pond.  Once the target has been isolated, the men will position the lassos, and with a lot of patience, time and nerves, slip them around the snout and up the tail.  The rear lasso has to go as far up the tail as possible, best right up to the hind legs, as it’s the widest point, or it might slip off when you hoist the crocodile up and out of the enclosure. The tail also reflexively thrashes around as soon as the croc feels some movement at that end, so it might give the just-in lasso the slip even before it gets as far up as the hip.  Once the lassos are in place, the two men will go “One, Two, Three, NOW!”, lift the crocodile out and, THUMP, straight onto the lawn.  A third man drops a sack over the crocodile’s head, so that it cannot see what’s going on. He places his knee on the trunk of the crocodile, to pin it down to the ground. He then pulls its front legs over onto its back and ties them together.  The front man tightens the lasso into a knot, thus clamping the crocodile’s jaws firmly shut. The one at the back pulls up the crocodile’s hind legs over onto its back, and ties them together.  They then slip a stick under the ropes that tie up the front and hind legs, pick up the crocodile this way, and carry it to the waiting lorry.  Being a girl and only ten years old, as well as having looked after the crocs since their babyhood, I found it very upsetting to witness them being trapped, tied up and carted off to be flayed. Even more so when, in the process of resisting capture, they would thrash around in the enclosure and end up bashing their snouts against the brick walls.  Throughout the capturing process, I’d run around the men, urging them, “Be gentle! Be gentle! Don’t hurt them! Don’t hurt them!”  They’d laugh at me, “Hahahaha, silly girl. Don’t hurt a crocodile, indeed! Wait till they bite you, or EAT you — you won’t be feeling so charitable then.”  The sight of the overpowered crocodiles, lying there on the lawn with a bloody snout, helplessly trussed up with their legs held backwards over their back, never failed to sadden me to the core. Even to this day, 60 years later — more than the thought of them being skinned to become some wealthy and face-conscious man or woman’s fashion accessories.  They might be crocodiles, but I’d looked after them since they were babies. The look of utter defeat and helplessness went straight to my heart every time. No pride or dignity left at all. So humiliating.  (Singapore, 1960s)  "

  "title": "Kitty the heterochromia cat",
  "body": " Kitty the heterochromia cat  We’d always had one dog and one cat at home. If the dog died, we’d replace it; ditto the cat.  Kitty Kat was the most outstanding one of the cats down the generations. He was not only striking in his looks, being completely white with one blue eye and one green eye, he was also very intelligent: interactive and communicative.  If he was hungry, he’d miaow insistently at you in a certain tone of voice that says, “Where’s my food? Isn’t it ready yet? I’m h-u-n-g-r-y! I want my food now!!”  If he came to sleep with me and wanted to go out halfway through the night, he’d miaow in a certain voice that said, “Please can you let me out, I need to go out.” Even the volume was decreased, as it was in the middle of the night. If I didn’t respond to that almost-whispered request, he’d paw gently at my face to wake me up fully.  Our animals were not allowed in the house. My mother’s sister, San Yee (三姨 “Third Auntie”), was very strict about this. She’d shoo the cat or the dog out, should they be bold enough to sneak in while her back was turned. We children would get told off if we were found to have encouraged the animal into the house, no matter how briefly.  My Sunday habit was to go straight to one of the two sofas in the living room after getting up, and spend the rest of the day there in a horizontal position, reading and grazing on apples and milk.  Kitty Kat, presumably having first checked that my aunt was not in sight, would come and sit on the floor by the sofa, look up at me and miaow sweetly, in a begging tone of voice, “Can I come up and sit by you, please?” I’d then shift towards the back of the sofa, pat the space and say, “上來 shànglái \/ come up!” Kitty would then jump up and snuggle up against me, purring blissfully. He always waited for me to say 上來; he was never presumptuous. (Someone in the family — don’t know who — had started the tradition of speaking to the dog in English and Mandarin Chinese to the cat. Boo Tat, an RI [Raffles Institution] classmate of mine, suggested: “Divide and rule!”)  One Sunday afternoon, the whole family was watching a Hong Kong film on the box, all scattered around the living room: on the floor, on the other sofa and four armchairs.  For some reason, Kitty didn’t spot my aunt in the crowd. He came up to my sofa, sat on the floor and begged in his usual persuasive manner to be allowed up on the sofa with me. Conscious of my aunt’s presence, I had to harden my heart and said to Kitty, “不行，姨媽說你不能上來 bù xíng, Yímā shuō nǐ bù néng shànglái \/ No, Auntie says you can’t come up!” All Kitty heard was the last two sounds “上來 shànglái \/ come up”, so he leapt up straightaway. Even my aunt had to laugh and indulge him for once.  One night, Kitty brought a girlfriend home. I saw them frolicking in the moonlight among the vegetables we’d grown on the newly-turfed (but yet to be fully-grown) lawn, leaping in and out of the veg clumps, chasing each other.  A few months after I’d spied Kitty’s moonlit romp, he disappeared. When days went by and he failed to return, we assumed he’d been killed by a car, since we lived by a main road.  Yet a few more months later, Kitty returned! We were so pleased he was alive and made a big fuss of him.  One day, however, I noticed Kitty behaving strangely over his food. He was eating very slowly and hesitantly, and would occasionally look to his left and right. I decided to hide behind a window that looked onto the covered patio area where the dog’s and cat’s food dishes were left out. Kitty carried on eating slowly, and was now looking around more frequently.  When he was sure of the total absence of the humans, he made a noise in his throat — a totally new sound to me: it was unlike the one he used when demanding his dinner, or the one he used when asking to be let out of my bedroom in the middle of the night, or when requesting to be allowed onto the sofa with me.  Within a few seconds, down from the patio roof came another cat. I recognised her as the other party of the midnight gambol those many moons ago. Kitty had brought his girlfriend home! So, he must’ve been living at her place all those months he’d gone missing. Why he’d come home (not feeling welcomed by the girlfriend’s host family?), I didn’t care. I was just so happy he’d not been struck down by a car, and that he’d chosen to bring her home to us .  So that was why he was eating so slowly! He was leaving some of the food for her! And he had to be sure the humans were out of the way first, hence the looking to the left and the right.  After that, I’d leave out two dishes of food: one for him, and one for her. I’d also make sure we were nowhere in sight so that she could feel free to come down for her feed.  I used to wear canvas shoes for school, which I’d wash at the weekend, and leave on the corrugated roof of the patio to dry in the sun (especially if I’d left it a bit late, not washing them on Saturday…). One Sunday around 5 pm, when the sun’d lost its fierce heat, I climbed up the ladder to the roof to collect my shoes.  Before my eyes was a scene of domestic bliss (天倫之樂 tiānlún zhī lè; 天倫 tiānlún = natural bonds and ethical relationships between family members): Kitty and his girlfriend, reclining and basking in the residual warmth of the aluminium roof. They hadn’t spotted me as I’d been very quiet going up the ladder.  Around the relaxed couple were three little kittens, jumping up and down on daddy’s and mummy’s tummy, pouncing on their tails and biting the tips, chewing the tips of their ears or paws. They couldn’t have been more than a few months old. So that was why Kitty brought her home! To give birth in our roof. I felt most honoured indeed that he’d chosen to bring her to our place for the birth. We obviously could be trusted to treat her well.  After a few more minutes of the kittens’ energetic friskiness, Kitty issued forth another sound unfamiliar to me — a kind of deep growling in the throat — which made the kittens immediately stop biting and chewing, and settle down. So that was the stern-father’s-admonition voice: “Stop that! It hurts, you know! Stop it right now!”  From that day on, I’d leave out a third bowl: for the mother to produce more milk for the kittens, or maybe even for the kittens if they were ready for solids.  After a few more months, the whole family vanished, this time never to return.  (Singapore, 1960s)  PS: It was only long after I’d already written up this piece (first draft 2020), with all the details, and now decided to publish this collection of animal stories that I then googled for cats with one blue eye and one green eye and discovered that they are a rare breed originating in Thailand, called Khao Manee(\/Mani), meaning “white jewel” (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Khao_Manee), and that they’re “communicative and intelligent”, among other things. A friend’s brother, who’d been to Lake Van in eastern Turkey for his work with the UNHCR, said it’s just like a Turkish Van cat.  "

  "title": "Boo Bear the Alsatian",
  "body": "Boo Bear the Alsatian  Soon after we moved into the new place — a bungalow with a huge garden — a dog came through the gap in the front hedge one night. My brother gave her some food, she subsequently came back for more, then refused to go away. We called her Doggy. She was my brother’s dog.  Doggy later produced a daughter, whom we called Rover. Rover was attached to my eldest sister, and would sit by the front gate around 1.30 pm when she was expected back from school, facing the direction she’d be coming from.  After Rover died (from a road accident — we lived by a main road), Grandma’s Alsatian, Ah Ham, produced a son, which was given to us as a replacement. My eldest sister called him Boo Bear, after the cartoon character Yogi Bear’s side kick, Boo, whom Yogi Bear would call Boo Boo Boy.  Boo Bear adopted me as his mate. I was about eight.  I used to play wicked tricks on Boo Bear.  I frequently sat in a rattan bucket chair in the covered patio area, playing my harmonica or the small accordion, one leg crossed over the other, foot about eight inches above the ground. Boo Bear would come and sit on the floor in front of me and listen to my performance (sole audience for my solo!), resting his chin on the foot sticking out, eyes closed.  When he was nicely settled in, I’d uncross my legs, thus forcing his chin to lose its comfortable perch and rousing him from his nap. Then I’d cross my legs the other way, so the foot sticking out would now be facing the other direction. Boo Bear would shuffle round to that foot and rest his chin on it, but once he started to doze off, I’d uncross my legs, and start the process all over again.  He was ever so patient, never getting cross with me for disrupting his nap, each time repositioning his bum and chin anew.  My wicked tricks extended to food.  I used to sit in that same bucket chair while eating fruit as well. Boo Bear would immediately appear in front of me, gazing intently into my face. I knew what this meant: he wanted a share of my fruit — any fruit, even orange, except banana.  I’d ignore him, avoiding eye contact. He’d start licking his lips: tongue swish one way. I’d ignore him. Tongue swish the other direction. I’d ignore him. Swish one way, then the other in rapid succession. I’d ignore him. Swish one way, then the other, then swallow visibly hard and audibly loud — GULP! Sometimes more than once to drive his message home. Only then would I part with a piece of my fruit.  There was one odd thing about him, though: he didn’t like banana, yet he’d sit there and go through the whole process when I was eating a banana. I had to tell him eventually, after he’d done all the lip-licking and swallowing hard and loud, “This is banana. You don’t like banana,” break off a piece and hold it right up to his nose for him to smell it. His face was always a sight to behold: he’d look disgusted and crinkle his nose, “Uggh, is that what it is?!? I’ve been wasting my time,” then go away and leave me alone for the rest of my banana. It was odd that he couldn’t smell it until it was right up against his nose.  I’d normally call him Bear Bear, but if I was cross with him, it’d be “Boo!”. He’d instantly look sheepish and contrite, knowing he must’ve done something to bring forth my displeasure, and avoid eye contact.  Bear Bear was equally good at detecting sadness in me.  As the youngest in the family, I was not allowed to remonstrate even if I’d been wrongly accused of something. That’s just the Chinese style of upbringing — in those days anyway, and certainly in my family. You do not argue, you just accept it, it comes with your status (or lack of). The grown-ups are always right, and even if they’re wrong, you do not point this out. (If you do, you now have the new crime of being argumentative and insolent, so you’re still in the wrong! If for a different reason this time.) Face, you know — you do not make the grown-ups lose face.  In one of these situations, I’d go to the back of the house, where the garage was. The garage was just a roof on six pillars over a concrete floor, since this was Singapore with its hot and humid tropical climate. I’d go and sit against one of these pillars, and have a good cry over the injustice.  Bear Bear would suddenly appear at my side, his face lighting up, “Ah, that’s where you are!! I’ve been looking all over the place for you.” Then, his face would go, “Oh, you’re crying,” and his whole body would sober up. He would sit down quietly beside me. I’d put my hand on his shoulder, and start to give him the details: who said what, how unfair they’d been to accuse me of this and that, not giving me a chance to answer back and clear my name. All this time, he’d wear a sombre look and his eyes would say, “Yes, yes, I understand, that’s so unfair, isn’t it? Poor you. I sympathise.” He’d lick my hand or face as further proof of his support.  When I’d got it all off my chest, my mood would lift, and Bear Bear would immediately twig: he’d get up, almost hopping on the spot, with his face and eyes lighting up, “OK, can we go and play now!? Can we, can we?!?”  Because of his sensitivity to my body language, poor Bear Bear would also fall prey to the trick I played on him every time I wanted to give him a wash.  Singapore used to import a high proportion of its water from Malaysia — still does, but a smaller amount now (we used to have three reservoirs, now 15) — with every drop metered. To collect rainwater, my father had built a water butt out of concrete rings, with a diameter of six feet and each about a foot in height, piled up to seven or eight rings high to reach the gutter. (The same concrete rings he’d used to build the crocodile nursery, using just three rings.) This water would be used for the plants, and for cleaning the car, the drains, the floor — and the dog (plus the cat on the one disastrous occasion — see also Giving the cat a bath ).  If Bear Bear knew I was going to give him a wash, he’d dig his heels in after I’d put the chain around his neck, so that I’d have to tug and pull, scold and cajole: “Come on! This will be good for you. You’ll like it. You’ll be nice and clean. It won’t take long.” This stalemate would often go on for ages.  The quicker way was for me to sneak up on him when his head was turned, slip the chain around his neck ever so quickly, then assume a bubbly body language, “Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!” and start to run. He’d think it was some kind of game, and get quite excited, and start to follow me.  Trot trot trot, a few yards round the corner, screech to a halt by the water butt, chain firmly wound round the tap, and poor Bear Bear would discover there was no game after all. Every single time, every single week, he’d fall for it. Such a trusting chap.  He was very good with me, though: he accepted defeat each time, and would stand there obediently, surrendering to his fate.  On my part, I must say in my own defence, especially after the dirty trick business, I was very good with him, too, during the wash.  I’d wet him and say in an enthusiastic voice, “There! Isn’t that nice! So N-I-C-E and C-O-O-L in this heat! See? I knew you’d like it!”  I’d soap him and say, “Doesn’t this soap smell NICE! All that body grease and dirt collected over the week — you don’t want to be walking around with that, do you?”  I’d scrub him and say, “There! Your own personal massage! Gets the circulation going. Nobody else gets this treatment, you know. You’re so lucky!”  When I was rinsing him, I’d say, “Look at you, all nice and C-L-E-A-N, smelling S-O-O-O good! And you’ve been such a G-O-O-D boy!”  Then I’d undo the chain, “You’re all done!! See? Didn’t take much time, did it? Now you’re FREE!”  He’d rush off to the lawn, shake off all the excess water, and tear around the garden, with me chasing him as a nod in the direction of the game he’d initially thought I was going to play with him. So, all ended well.  As an Alsatian, it was in Bear Bear’s blood to be fierce and fearsome. (Almost 60 years on, it’s suddenly struck me that the sound “boo”, in the S.E. Chinese dialects of 潮州 \/ Cháozhōu \/ Teochew and 福建 \/ Fújiàn \/ Hokkien, can be 武 (wǔ in Mandarin), meaning “military, valiant, fierce”. It is the same wǔ as in wǔshù 武術 \/ martial arts. So it was a very appropriate name after all, serendipitously.)  Being fierce and fearsome meant guarding the house against intruders.  Even if those “intruders” were just little old ladies and young children walking past the house.  Or the Malay postman (a genetically-built-in-target for dogs) on his bicycle.  Or the Indian man delivering bread on his bicycle, tiered box on the rear rack for the loaves.  Or the Chinese man selling soya sauces and sesame oil, on one of those pedal-bike arrangements with a cart in front for the kegs — like a bicycle trailer but in front. He would call out “s-ě-ě yáo” (Cantonese for “soya sauce”) as he cycled along, so that we’d know he was coming.  To his credit, Bear Bear was not racist. Ageist, elitist, snobbish, maybe — but not racist. He’d have a go at them, whatever their skin colour.  Our house did have a gate, but it wasn’t always properly latched. Bear Bear would somehow hear these delivery men, even if he was at the back of the house. Off he would charge to the front gate, and if the latch wasn’t on, he’d get out like a shot.  The images are still fresh in my mind to this day, nearly 60 years later. It would be funny were it not for the consequences.  The Malay postman frantically trying to pedal away with one foot (a skill he obviously hadn’t quite mastered, and which all postmen need to, I feel), the other foot trying to ward off the dog that was charging up to him, teeth bared. Sometimes, the poor man’s hand would still be in the letter box slot, in the midst of pushing the letters through.  The Indian man nervously trying to stop the dog from getting too close to him, instinctively holding out the loaf of bread in front of him as a shield. Many a time, we’d end up with a half-bitten-off loaf delivered, or a loaf abandoned altogether, just sitting on the ground as the poor man made his escape. (As we lived by a main road, you can imagine the sight that greeted the drivers, passengers and pedestrians: a loaf of bread sitting by itself in the road, causing the vehicular and human traffic to wend its way around it until I went to pick it up off the tarmac.) After a few more times of this, the man would stand on the other side of the road and ring his bicycle bell, so I had to cross the road and collect the bread myself.  The Chinese soya sauce and sesame oil man — in a Chinese-style cotton garment (Chinese collar, Chinese cloth buttons) and a large pointed-top palm-leaf hat (the type one sees on rice field workers, especially in Vietnam) — instinctively using his conical hat to try and block the progression of the dog’s teeth, and getting a chunk of the tip bitten off. (Might’ve been his fingers…) After a few repeats, that man never stopped outside our house again. He’d actually pedal faster as he approached our gate, so we had to run down the road after him if we spotted him. Or, if he had managed to sneak past our house altogether, go and get our soya sauce and sesame oil from the shop.  Other attacks were a bit more serious: often a young child, aged four or five, thus about the right height for a dog to bite in the face; an old person, often too doddery to run away or thrust some form of barrier in the path of the suddenly advancing dog. These were the ones who were actually bitten, which meant our not only apologising profusely (as we had to do with those delivery men) but also giving them money to go for a tetanus jab, just in case. Nowadays (or in some litigious country), we’d have been sued many times over.  After each biting, my mother — and Uncle Kim, her brother, if he happened to be visiting — would tie Bear Bear to a pillar, and beat him, berating him at the same time, “You stupid dog! Do you know how much you’re costing us!” Whack, shout, whack, shout.  As the youngest member at home, and being only 12, I was not in a position to challenge their authority, so I had to stand aside, witnessing poor Bear Bear being beaten on each occasion, fighting back the tears, almost unable to watch any of it. I felt the pain as if I’d been at the receiving end myself.  After each beating, I would go and sit with him, still chained to the pillar, putting my arms around his neck, crying and stroking him to comfort him and ease some of the physical and emotional pain and humiliation of being beaten and shouted at. “Why do you keep doing this? Don’t you know that you’re the one to suffer in the end? Why haven’t you learned after all these beatings? Don’t do it again. For your own sake.”  Bear Bear did actually eventually learn, but his pride and reputation as a guard dog had to be preserved and maintained (which was why he did all that in the first place), so he came up with a compromise: he would charge up to the “intruder”, growling or barking, teeth bared, but stop short of actually making contact with the flesh. This meant he could do his duty of menacing the “intruder” without incurring a financial loss to his owner. Each time, I’d tell him how proud I was of him, “Well done! You see? No beating, no shouting at you. You can learn, and you do learn. Well done, Bear Bear. Clever boy.”  This extra level of intelligence and logical mental processing in Bear Bear was also manifested in the sessions for getting rid of the lice and fleas.  I’d chain him to a pillar of the covered patio, sit down on a stool beside him with a comb, a pair of tweezers and a jar of paraffin, and get to work.  They tended to team up — parasite in every sense: not just parasitising on the host (the dog in this case) but parasitising on each other as well (one opening up the hole in the skin, the other jumping on the bandwagon and exploiting this initial effort). A fattened, full-up louse, all grey and waxy — the size of a ladybird, and actually looking like a ladybird in shape as well, but plump and soft, unlike a ladybird’s (seemingly) hard outer covering. Next to it, a scrawny and much smaller flea, browny-red and spider-like with its legs. By cosying up to each other, they saved me work, as I could pluck them out as a pair and drop them into the paraffin. Two bloodsuckers with one tweezer move.  The plucking was not painless for Bear Bear, as the pests had their teeth sunk quite firmly into his flesh, so he’d flinch each time, and try to get away. Being chained to the pillar, however, he could only shift a few inches away from me. I’d then move my little bamboo stool a few inches towards him, and start plucking again.  This series of manoeuvres — him shuffling away (albeit by only a few inches), me moving up to him, him shuffling away, me moving up to him — would end up with him going round and round the pillar, shortening the chain until eventually he couldn’t go anywhere. Except in reverse — but then I was blocking his path back. So that was it. The poor chap had to sit out the rest of the plucking with no escape, not even by a few inches nor for a few more seconds. He never got angry or impatient with me, though, for inflicting this discomfort on him, such was his trust in me — he just went along with it because it was me (see later for more examples of this unconditional trust in me).  After a number of times of this — which didn’t bother me at all actually, even if it meant I couldn’t do the plucking sitting still in one long session — I decided to try explaining to him what I was doing.  I showed him the plucked-out offenders, gripped between the ends of the tweezers, “You see these things? These nasty things are biting into your flesh. They are sucking out your blood. They are living off you. Your itching and scratching is all due to them. I know the plucking is a bit unpleasant, but it’s all for your good, so if you’ll just put up with it, you’ll feel better once I’ve got rid of them for you. You’ll be itch-free and scratch-free once I’m done. Be patient and bear with me. I’m doing this for your good.”  Bear Bear bared his teeth at the nasties, apparently understanding everything I’d said. After that, no more shifting to get away from me. No more “chasing” him round the pillar until the chain couldn’t be shortened any further. He remembered too, for future sessions down the line. What a clever dog he was.  Both the post-beating talk and the tick-\/louse-plucking explanation, and their subsequent results, just go to show the level of intelligence Bear Bear possessed.  One cold and rainy morning, I was woken up by someone in the family pushing me roughly, “Get up, get up! Boo Bear’s been hurt! Go and see him!”  I found him sitting on the verandah, trembling. When I got closer, I saw what he was trembling from: the pain and the shock. It was obvious he’d just been in a fight somewhere — one eye had been scratched out. I also started to tremble from the shock of the sight of this, and could almost feel the pain myself as well.  As a teenager and not having ever come across anything like that before, I just didn’t know what to do.  In those days, we didn’t use vets for our animals. We just let them be: live the lives they were meant to live. Dogs were there to guard the house, cats were there to catch mice. They ate whatever leftover food we humans gave them — maybe a special treat now and then if we had more or surplus food (e.g., extra fish from the wholesale fishery market my father worked at). They slept on the covered patio floor, without a basket or a box — that was all right, in Singapore’s hot tropical climate. If they felt unwell, they just went out to the garden, ate some grass, coughed up the poison, and got well of their own accord. If they died, we buried them in the garden.  Now in hindsight, as an adult, I wish I’d thought of bringing out a blanket to throw over him, if only to keep him warm from the cold and rainy morning, and the shock.  I went to sit with him, stroking his head and body, “Oh, Bear Bear! How did this happen? What happened? Have you been in a fight? You poor thing. Oh, Bear Bear! You poor thing.” I cried and cried — I’m crying now as I’m writing this. Even when my hand went anywhere near his injured eye, he never once flinched. He totally trusted me not to hurt him, even if accidentally.  After a few weeks, the dislocated eye shrivelled up and dropped off, leaving an empty socket.  One day, someone spotted that the empty eye socket had maggots.  My mother’s sister, San Yee (“Third Auntie”), being a nurse (and a grown-up), undertook to clean it up, with one of my sisters (being an older teenager) in attendance, in case she needed a hand — with holding the dog still or something. I was too squeamish to even watch from the side, so I stood some distance away.  A few minutes later, they called me over. Bear Bear wouldn’t let them get near that eye. He was growling and baring his teeth at them, trying to shift away, and even turning his head away whenever San Yee approached with the tweezers.  So, I went to him, “I know it’s not nice, and you must be worried about them putting a pair of tweezers near that eye, but it’s for your good. There are some nasties in there, some maggots, and they’ll be eating away your eye cavity if we don’t remove them. We just need to get rid of them, wash out the eye with some disinfectant, then the maggots will be gone for ever. We’re doing this for your good. Be a good boy.”  Again, he understood what I said, and sat still throughout the maggot-removing session — I was with him, with my hands on his body, but my eyes were averted, so squeamish was I about such things. He kept still right to the end, which again shows the amazing level of intelligence (and trust in me) he had. After that cleaning-up exercise, the eye socket never had any more trouble.  (Now, once again in hindsight as I’m writing this in my late 60s, I realise that the maggots might actually be good for his injured eye cavity. Google says: Quote Larvae therapy involves applying maggots to a wound to help it heal. Maggots can be used to treat dirty or infected wounds as they remove dead tissue and bacteria (germs), leaving behind healthy tissue that can heal. The maggots used in this treatment are specially bred and are sterile so they cannot cause infection. Unquote)  We never took our dog or cat with us when we went anywhere in the car, not even to Grandma’s coconut plantation where there was plenty of room for them to run around and explore — actually, maybe precisely because of this, as they'd get lost. It just wasn’t the cultural practice of the time. Dogs were there to guard the house, not to be taken out on a car ride.  Bear Bear’s first car journey, unfortunately, was for a sad reason. He’d become old, and we noticed he wasn’t eating properly, not just more slowly. He was also slower in his movements, of course.  One day, after he’d had a hacking cough for a few days, my mother and sister decided to take him to the vet downtown. So, somehow, they managed to find out about a vet — that was how much they thought of him.  Again, as I was the youngest, it wasn’t something for me to be a part of. Nasty things were for the grown-ups to deal with: burying the dog or cat; cleaning up after a new puppy or kitten had messed the floor.  After a few minutes, my sister came back to the house and asked me to go lend a hand.  Bear Bear had refused to get into the car. I thought, “Perhaps it’s because he’d never been in a car before, he doesn’t know what to do — it is strange territory to him.”  They’d tried to push him into the car from behind — no. They tried pulling him in from inside the car — no. They tried coaxing him, “Come, Bear Bear, come. Get in.” No.  When I turned up, I simply climbed onto the back seat, moved inside a little bit to make some room near the door, and patted the empty space by me. Bear Bear immediately jumped in and sat next to me. I kept my arms around him for the whole journey into town.  Squeamish though I am about such things, I went into the treatment room with Bear Bear, to help him cope with the unfamiliar surroundings and the unknown man (the vet). Even though he was shaking, partly because he was unwell, and partly because he was scared of the strange surroundings, Bear Bear bravely put up with being handled by this stranger, who was pushing a thermometer up his backside, and sticking a needle into his flank. I think it was all because I was there by his side, comforting and reassuring him. And he trusted me.  A couple of days later, I found Bear Bear lying on the floor next to his food bowl, a lump of food by his mouth. It looked like he’d choked on this lump of food, although he did manage to find the strength to cough it up. (Once again, in hindsight, we should’ve thought of cutting up his food into tiny pieces.) The effort of coughing up that lump of food must’ve been too much for him.  Nearly sixty years on, I still often think about this dear four-legged playmate and soulmate of mine, who saw me through my teens. I still shed a tear — quite a few, actually. I still miss him.  I never came across another dog as intelligent or as sensitive as Boo Bear the Alsatian.  (Singapore, 1960s)  "

A Central European country was trying to develop its tourist trade. Being landlocked with no beaches, it had to look to mountain- and forest-based activities to attract tourists.  One of the suggestions put forward was a hunting trip: hire a bear, release it near where the tourists are in the forest, but give them blanks, so that the bear can be recycled. This idea was duly taken up and implemented.  On the day in question, the tourists were taken to somewhere in a forest, and left to walk around for a little while first — mustn’t release the bear too soon, must let them have the thrill of looking for a bit before “chancing upon” the bear.  At some point, along came an old lady, cycling through the forest, on her way to visit her sister, when the released bear wandered out of the trees onto the forest path.  The old lady shrieked, abandoned her bike and ran away, at which point, witnessed by the tourists, the bear got on the bike and cycled off.  It was a circus bear the Tourist Board had hired.

  "body": "Birds  Bird behaviour  I’m house sitting in south London, in a leafy private road with two-storey four-bedroom detached houses surrounded by trees.  One day a couple of months back, the weather got quite squally.  On the bare rooftop of the house (to the left) across the road was an upright grey shape next to the 2ft-high chimney pot, looking like a heron, taller than the chimney pot — just sitting very still. Not quite believing my eyes (why would a bird sit out there, unsheltered, in the wind and rain?), I watched it for a long time, waiting for some movement, to check that it was really a bird rather than something bird-like erected on the roof that I hadn’t noticed before. After a while, I gave up.  When I went back later to the window and looked out, the heron shape had gone. So, it had indeed been a bird. With so many trees around for it to hide in, it was obviously up there to be lashed by the wind and the rain, as there was nothing else on this rooftop for it to experience.  (I was judging that heron with my own human standards: why sit out there in the wind and rain? Reminds me of once, after work in Taipei, when colleague Peggy walked me to the street a few blocks away from the Conoco office to catch my bus home. It was drizzling. I said I’d like to walk on for a bit. Peggy immediately became concerned, “Would you like to talk about it?” To the Chinese, if someone wants to walk in the rain, it must be because they have something on their mind.)  A few hundred yards away, beyond the house opposite (to the right), the tops of the copse of a dozen (100ft?) tall fir trees were swaying wildly, as the rain pelted down.  I love watching the swaying of tree tops (among other things) — used to spend most of the day at home childminding the two daughters on school holiday when I was staying with an ex-schoolmate in Sydney, watching the tops of the eucalyptus trees a few hundred yards away swaying, imagining a Heidi sort of scene, although I didn’t have the sound effects. (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heidi)  I then noticed that a huge flock of birds (at least 30, if not 50) were flying around the top of these fir trees and actually landing on the upper branches, even though the wind was strong and it was raining quite heavily.  The gusty wind meant they didn’t always get a firm foothold, if at all, with the tree tops swaying so violently, but they kept returning — shaken off balance, they’d have another go at landing and hanging on, again and again and again, for ages and ages.  One would’ve thought that they’d go and hide under some big tree somewhere out of the wind and rain, so it must mean that they were actually doing it on purpose, treating it as a game: to see if they could land, and how long they’d stay on the branches before being shaken off. Or perhaps merely to land and experience the swaying as entertainment, like humans enjoying a roller-coaster ride.  Interesting behaviour.  (London, UK, 2023)   The homing pigeon that won’t go home  (This first appeared as a journal entry, then a blog.)  Vláda found a pigeon sitting on the Hutĕ village green one day, apparently injured, with a bald patch in the neck area. It was a young bird, he could tell, and had a ring tag, so it must be a homing pigeon.  Vláda put it in a coop up in his loft, which is warm, fed it some grain and left it to recover. It did, after a couple of days.  That was a fortnight ago. Since then, the bird has been following Vláda around, obviously associating him with food, and is refusing to go home. Or it’s too young and doesn’t know its way home, which is perhaps how it came to be on the village green in the first place.  There’d been two other pigeons found on the village green last year. One died of exhaustion. Vláda put up a notice on the internet about the second one, and a week later its owner called from Brno (about 100 km away) to say it’d arrived home safely.  Update on Monday 150811: This current pigeon was last seen on Friday morning, 120811, so we assume it’s plucked up courage and gone home. Perhaps it’s the food on offer here, i.e., not good enough. Perhaps it's the constant presence of Tiapka the cat. (Tiapka means ‘paws’ in Czech, and she is so named because she has two-toed paws.) I have suggested to Vláda that he check out Tiapka’s tummy contents but he prefers to think the pigeon’s checked out of Hotel Hutĕ.  Update on Wednesday 170811: Vláda says he’d gone to the trouble of getting hold of the contact number for the pigeon fanciers’ association, to whom he gave the pigeon’s ring tag number, and they tracked down the owner. Vláda then got in touch with the owner, who suggested Vláda drive the bird to a place nearer his house, then release it for it to fly home on its own. Maybe the bird got wind of this, which is why it suddenly disappeared from Hutĕ: the reason it ran away from home in the first place was it didn't like it there, and now Vláda has actually traced its owner and is going to deliver it home (well, part of the way anyway).  Vláda also said that for the whole of the fortnight in Hutĕ, the bird never uttered a single sound, but on the morning that it disappeared, it sat on the eaves and cooed at Vláda. We both think it was saying goodbye.  (Hutĕ, Czech Republic, 2011)  Note: Hutĕ is a hamlet of eight households — six cottages in a terrace and, on the other side of the patch of bare land (which I romantically call “village green”), a big house partitioned into two. The inhabitants used to be the manager and workers of the local glass factory. For those who don’t already know, the Czech Republic (previously Czechoslovakia) is famous for its glassware. My hosts, teachers Vláda and Jana, say they still occasionally unearth shards in their kitchen garden and the surrounding fields (owned by the local government, planting various crops for feeding livestock).

  "body": "Cats  Basil the tailless cat  (This first appeared as a blog.)  The Highwood Road house had a garden at the back.  I’d get home from work, change straight out of my outdoor clothes into old gardening gear, and go and do some weeding in the garden until it got dark.  The path from the kitchen door to the garden was lined with cherry trees. The trunks were about 4 inches (10 cms) in diameter.  After the first day, a stocky black and white cat with a docked tail (or he was a Manx cat) would come and join me in my weeding, staying around me throughout, sitting somewhere close by. Housemate Sheila later told me he was next door’s cat Basil — she’d heard them calling him.  The window of my half-landing rear bedroom overlooked the roof of the kitchen extension. I’d leave it open in the warm weather. Basil found his way into my room one evening, by climbing onto the kitchen roof, then up onto my window sill. He’d come every night and sleep in my bed.  One day, I was walking down the garden path to go and do some weeding when I saw Basil sitting behind one of the cherry trees. His head was hidden by the tree trunk, but the rest of his body stuck out.  I'd thought initially that he was just sitting there, daydreaming and minding his own business, but when I got closer to the tree, Basil suddenly stepped out into the path, stood up on his hind legs, raised his upper legs into the air (like someone surrendering), mouth wide open, in a silent “BOO!” gesture. So, he was hiding behind the tree, lying in wait for me!  It obviously didn’t occur to him that the tree trunk was too narrow to hide the rest of his body. He must’ve thought, just because he couldn’t see me (with his head, and therefore eyes too, behind the tree trunk), that I couldn’t see him either. Haha.  PS: Having written this blog, it occurred to me that people in this country don’t tend to dock the tails of dogs and cats (unlike in Singapore during my childhood when it was done), so Basil must be a Manx cat. Googling the traits of Manx cats produces “playful” for one of them!  (London, UK, 1983)  From googling: QUOTE. The Manx is considered a social and gregarious cat, and very attached to humans, but also shy of strangers. The breed is said to be highly intelligent, playful, and in its behaviour reminiscent of dogs. For example, like some Maine Coons and a few other breeds, Manx cats often learn to fetch small thrown objects. They may also follow their owners about like puppies, and are believed to be better able to learn simple verbal commands than most cats. …temperament …“quaint and interesting” … “docile, good-tempered and sociable” UNQUOTE   Four-legged heat radar  Ben, two years below me at SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London), threw a dinner party at his flat in north London. There were about six or eight of us, including his brothers Lloyd and Adam.  It was my first acquaintance with venison — tasted a bit like beef in texture and flavour, maybe because it was done the Chinese 紅燒 hóngshāo style (dark soya sauce), which is a common Chinese way of cooking beef.  In typical university-student fashion, we stayed up until way past midnight, drinking and jaw-jawing. Then, too late for public transport, we camped down on the living room floor, aligned like sardines. That was very common in those days — the 70s.  Part-way through what was left of the night, I started to have a dream about being held under a huge boulder, unable to even turn a little, struggling a bit to breathe.  Then, the boulder started to purr!  The shock woke me up. Ben’s cat was perched comfortably on my chest, purring contentedly.  Cats are such experts at tracking down the hot spots. You can always tell which parked car in the street has just arrived, by the cat(s) sitting on the bonnet.  (London, UK, 1979\/1980)   Giving the cat a bath  (This first appeared as a blog.)  Made the mistake, during my teens, of trying to wash the cat.  Thought I was being clever shutting all three doors to the bathroom first, so that the cat couldn’t escape.  As soon as I started to scoop water out of the bucket onto the cat, there was a mad flurry of PAWS , HANDS, CLAWS , ARMS, TEETH . Water all over the bathroom. Water all over me.  Not to mention the MEOW s and YEOW s — from me as well.  Never again. Lesson learned.  (Singapore, 1960s)   The homing cat  (This first appeared as a blog.)  A friend, Daniel, bought a house in north London from a lady who then moved a few streets away.  Her cat — a pale stripy tom that looks like a discoloured zebra — refuses to accept that they have now moved and keeps coming back to his old home, blatantly lying around in the open patio just outside the kitchen, or in the covered patio at the bottom of the garden, or just about anywhere he cares to occupy proprietorially, as if it was still his territory.  If he is shooed away, he’ll move only just out of striking distance, e.g., from the kitchen patio area to the back patio. If Daniel keeps up the chasing, he’ll move out of the garden only as far as just the other side of the back fence, then sit on the roof of that neighbour’s garden shed, and vociferously and plaintively rail at Daniel about the injustice of being ousted from what he perceives to be his rightful turf.  He can easily out-meow you — cat food manufacturers should cash in on his energy levels and approach his mistress about getting him to star in their adverts for their products.  I was witness, on one occasion, to Daniel chasing him out of the back patio area and his fully answering back from the top of the neighbour’s garden shed.     And it went on and on and on. Even after Daniel gave up arguing, he still didn’t let up, carrying on with his one-party verbal war like a grumpy old man muttering loudly.  The cat’s name? Believe it or not: Homer.  (London, UK, 2010)   Jean-Louis and the little black cat  (This first appeared as a journal entry, then a blog.)  Jean-Louis is the neighbour who lives one kilometre from the French farm, down by the main road — the A21 that runs south to the Pyrénées.  He comes up quite regularly to deliver pain (bread) when it’s his turn, as he and Jeanette alternate their pain-buying trips, which is very ecological and economical. (Haha, if this was in Britain, I could do another alliteration trick by calling it “saving petrol, pounds and pollution”!)  Colette told me before this winter trip of mine that the frisky black cat (mentioned in Purrfect pals) has taken a particular fancy to him, jumping into his arms the moment he arrives and rubbing herself feverishly against the big man’s big beard. Without meaning to undermine Jean-Louis’s attraction for the furry inhabitants on the farm, I suggested to Colette that the black cat might’ve been nuzzling up to his generously hirsute face for its usefulness as a de-fleaing device.  One day, I came back in to the farm house from working outside to find Jean-Louis had arrived but the black cat was not in his arms as usual but on the sofa. A closer inspection of his face disclosed the fact that he’d had a shave, which would prove my theory right about her using his face for de-fleaing.  (Verbatim from journal entry of 271211) Martial has replaced J-L tonight in the cat’s affections. Martial has a full beard. Spot the link?  (Gers, S.W. France, 2011)   Jiang the Afghan cat  Jiang 薑, which means “ginger” in Chinese, is so named because of his colouring. Not “ginger” in the Western red hair colour sense, but root ginger, the common ingredient in Chinese cooking.  His owners, Irish David and English Jane, had done a degree in Chinese.  Jiang is a long lean cat. His fur is speckled with various shades of brown. His tail is a gorgeous series of rings of darker and paler brown, like a lemur’s tail.  I was visiting David and Jane one day, standing at their front door after having rung the bell, when I suddenly looked up and spotted Jiang sitting on the external sill of the first floor window, looking to the distance like he was day-dreaming. I called out to him, “Jiang!” He turned round, immediately answered back, and actually started to walk along the eaves over the ground floor (which is rather precarious) to come over to me. He did reach me, jumping down from the first floor.  A while later, David asked me to go over and stay overnight a few times a week during the three weeks he and Jane were going away to Botswana. A neighbour would come round and put down food and water, he said, but they felt that Jiang needed company. The last time they went away for three weeks, Jiang wouldn’t leave them alone after they got back: he stuck to their heels wherever they went in the house, refusing to let them out of his sight, as if afraid of being abandoned.  As an evening teacher, with post-lesson pubbing sessions with my mature students after classes at nine o’clock, I would only arrive at David and Jane’s house around 11.30 pm. Feeling that I couldn’t just go straight to bed, I’d switch on the TV, sit on the floor, leaning back at a 60-degree angle against the front of the sofa, almost in a horizontal position. Jiang would come and sit on my chest, stretching out his long body over my front, his hind legs down my upper legs to just above my knees, and his head below my chin, paws wrapped around my neck. He’d then go to sleep happily in this position, leaving me unable to move until my legs went numb and I had to shift, or I had to go to bed.  It was just before the cat-sitting stint that I got an attack of bad back. My lower back suddenly simply gave way one day as I was walking down the road — without my usual rucksack, ironically. I felt a sharp twinge, and couldn’t stand up straight after that. I tried all sorts of things: stretching, massaging my back with a tennis ball, using the hand-held massaging rod from China.  A Japanese colleague gave me some heat pads, each individually packed and sealed. The moment you open the pack, the contents, which feel like crushed up lava or porous gravel, will start to get hot upon exposure to air, lasting some ten hours. You slap one on the affected area, held down with some tape.  I’d open one of these heat pads at bedtime at David and Jane’s, so that I could sleep pain-free. It was winter at the time. Jiang was normally not allowed in the bedrooms, but I decided to let him sleep in my bed for a prolonged duration of human contact, since he was left alone all day.  Part-way through the night, I was woken up by this feeling of a huge weight on my right hip — I’d been lying on my left side. It turned out to be Jiang perched on my hip, as that was the spot nearest my lower back, where the heat pad was. Cats are so good at finding heat sources, aren’t they? (See also Four-legged heat radar.) One always knows when a car’s just come back\/parked — from the cat sitting on its bonnet.  I left Jiang there for a bit longer, not wanting to disturb him in his sleep, so I was locked into that position for a while.  Then, I had to change position, so I picked him up, moved him off my right hip, and turned the other way. Back he’d climb onto the other (left) hip, and stay there until I had to change position again.  At one point, I changed position to lie on my back, so Jiang lost his perch on my hip. Undeterred, he then snuggled right up against my side.  This position shifting for me, and for ;the cat accordingly, went on every hour or so throughout the night. (Apparently, we toss and turn 40–50 times a night in our sleep.)  After David and Jane got back, they reported that there was an improvement in Jiang: he was not as clinging as before when they got back from their previous holiday. My back, however, had not improved in spite of those heat pads… Maybe because it had to carry the weight of a long lean cat perched on top, not daring to move for fear of disrupting the cat’s slumber.  (London, UK, 1990s)   Purrfect pals  (This first appeared as a journal entry, then a blog.)  For some reason, the cats on the French farm are not assigned any names. And have never been, I think.  The dogs are called Pastou, Fleurie, Mizou and so on. (Dino came already named Dino by his previous, now deceased, owner — see also Dino the dirty dog .)  The cats, however, are all simply addressed as Mimi (see also Minou), even when spoken to directly and singly.  (This reminds me of my own family’s tradition of treating the dog and the cat differently: speaking English to the dog and Mandarin to the cat.)  The frisky one (little black cat — see also Jean-Louis and the little black cat) will totally disrupt your reading or journal-writing, endlessly nudging your fingers, hands and any other part of your body that he can mark you with.  By “mark”, I mean mainly scent but he also leaves scratch marks when he jumps on or all over you, as well as (playful but painful) bite marks when he suddenly takes a fancy to your finger.  As soon as the one with tiger stripes spots you (haha, pun! stripes and spots), he will instantly claim your lap — or even chest if you’re sitting a bit reclined (as in a sun-lounger) — and go to sleep, freezing you in the one pose until your legs go numb. If you move him to de-numb your legs, he will instantly climb back on. (See also Jiang the Afghan cat .)  If you’ve got something on your lap (e.g., dry haricot bean pods to shell), Tiger (my name for him) will sit on the bit of sun-lounger beside or behind you, basically staying close throughout even though you’re too busy to stroke or cuddle him.  If you leave the sun-lounger, so will he, which proves that he’s not there for the sun-lounger but for your company. One feels honoured to be adopted by cats in this way, as the Swiss ex-boyfriend used to say. (He had also called them “whores”, though, sucking up to anyone who will dish out the stroking and cuddling.)  Mummy Cat (as I call the variegated one with a series of successive broods, poor old girl) will try to get to your face for her to nuzzle, by climbing up your leg — or arm, if you bend down, say, to pull up some weeds — with her front legs. Sweet, but rather painful. She has this lovely touch of putting her paws on your shoulders, one on each side, then wrapping them round your neck in a big hug while she nuzzles your chin or cheek.  If you’re standing at a table, she’ll jump onto the table to try and get to you from that level. If you stand back, she’ll try and reach out, sometimes to the point of nearly falling off the table, in which case she’ll even keep three legs on the table and just use one to try and climb up your arm in her eagerness to get to your face for that nuzzle. Affectionate or demanding?  Practically all the cats are highly responsive and interactive, although in different ways. Each looks different (in colour combinations and patterns) and each has his\/her own very individualistic mannerisms and way of communicating with you. As I got to know each one, I found myself saying to them in turn every day — often more than once a day: “I wish I could take you back to London with me.” I can see why Serge and Jeanette have them around, even though it means extra work and cost, because they fill one’s life with so much affection.  The beige one (and mother of the black frisky one — they are both the same size and I’d mistaken them to be siblings) was the first to “adopt” me by greeting me from inside the bushy plant-climber cage by the front door before I’d even spotted her having a kip in there.  After the first few days of my arrival, she took to sleeping in my bed, then in my open suitcase among my clothes, and finally on it when I shut the lid to keep her out. She’d get to my room on the first floor by scaling the ground floor wooden shutters and then the stretch of wall between the shutters on the two storeys, thus endangering her nine lives.  The black canvas material of the suitcase was liberally covered with her pale hairs by the last day of my stay, but when Mauricette (visiting for a week with husband Simon) offered to brush them off, I said no, I wanted to keep it as it was — as a souvenir, to keep the memory of these purrfect pals alive and fresh.  (Gers, S.W. France, 2011)   Tiger the tyrant  (See also Purrfect pals.)  The first time I met Tiger was through the kitchen window of the French farm house.  I was working at the kitchen sink. On the window sill sat a large stripy cat, looking in. Like the rest of the cats on the farm, he didn’t have a name. Farm mistress Jeanette called him a monster.  Any leftovers or rejects (such as bones) from the preparation of the meal or the dining table would be taken out through the kitchen garden door for the six dogs and six cats. Tiger would leave his window sill spot, run round to the kitchen door and muscle in.  I didn’t like this bully boy behaviour, especially given his size, and would try and ward him off, using one hand to push him out of the way, so that the smaller cats could have their share of the food first.  This happened almost every time. I began to worry that Tiger might start to resent me, maybe even scratch or bite me in his eagerness to get to the food.  To make up for this unfair treatment, I’d sometimes give him priority by calling out to him when I had some treat to dole out. Amazingly, he recognised my name for him although he’d never been called that before (the cats on the farm are not given names — see also Minou), and would leave his window sill perch and come running round from the back of the farmhouse.  (The main diet of the dogs and cats on the farm were fed mainly stale baguette — from the bakery in the nearest village, in exchange for various produce from the farm: eggs, for example. It’d be soaked in water and lard, so anything outside of that is a treat, even kitchen scraps which are rejects from humans. I can’t help being reminded of the human situation with some countries being so picky about their food and others not even getting the bare minimum…. Or some humans in the same country even.)  It must’ve been this act of kindness on my part that warmed him to me. (Although I must say that all the cats on the farm are incredibly affectionate, and forgiving of any rough treatment. Ditto the dogs.)  Here are excerpts from my journal:  Monday 260911: The tiger cat went to the rabbit area looking for me when I went to feed them some greens around 6 pm, calling out calling out until I established eye contact with him through a gap in the corral door, then sat down in a depression under a little tree to wait for me to finish before following me back to the patio area.  Tuesday 270911: Tiger [came over to the sun lounger and] claimed my lap the moment I sat down although he was in the undergrowth by the downstairs bedroom (next to the kitchen), which is almost 10 ft away, so it’s definitely a conscious and deliberate effort\/initiative on his part. He’s now grooming himself. Earlier I had the black\/grey\/white cat (the one that crosses its front paws). Tiger followed me, like the beige cat before, on my snail-collecting trip, and like the beige cat kept trying to nudge my hand as soon as I lowered it to pick up some snails. After some sharp-toned discouragement, aided by my hand pushing him away, the message got home and he sat to one side waiting. Fast learner, but also very forgiving for he’s still friends with me.  021011: Tiger [was] happy to lie by or behind me on the sun recliner when I couldn’t have him on my lap as I was shelling the haricot. He seems genuinely happy to see, and be with, me: even when I call him over from the kitchen ledge — his usual spot — for a plate to lick, he’d just nuzzle my ankles without noticing the plate in my hand.  …  Tiger has been trying to stay close to me, bless him. Whenever I left the kitchen door open, he would come in to be with me, at the risk of being shoo’ed out by Jeanette. I then had to entice him out by walking out of the kitchen to the side garden, which would make him follow me, and run back in quickly after walking out far enough, and shutting the kitchen door on him, which makes me feel mean.  (Gers, S.W. France, 2009–2011)   The Turkish Van cat  Jenny, an Australian colleague at the film company (producing The Heart of the Dragon, a 12-part documentary series for Channel Four, 1984), was visiting a friend when she spotted the kitchen sink tap dripping, so she turned it off more tightly.  A little while later, it was dripping again, so she turned it off again.  This went on a number of times, so Jenny told her friend about it. The friend said, Oh, there’s nothing wrong with the washer. We’ve left it like this deliberately, as our cat likes to sit under the tap and let the water drip on his head.  The following day, Jenny walked past the toilet and saw the cat’s head protruding from the toilet bowl, its body immersed in the toilet.  It turned out that the breed of the cat is Turkish Van, from Lake Van in Turkey, where they swim in\/across the lake all the time.  (England, 1980s)   Xiǎo Lóng  Then-student was going back to Malaysia for a holiday, and asked me to look after her cat, Xiǎo Lóng 小龍 \/ “little dragon”.  What can you do when it’s someone else’s place? The point of my presence, anyway, as in the case of staying with Jiang (see Jiang the Afghan cat), is to keep the cat company: help it feel less alone and deserted. So, I sat in an armchair, reading, with my feet up on a pouffe. Xiǎo Lóng went on my lap: on all fours, with his face towards me but head dropped, in a doze.  This went on for a while. I then broke the silence and asked Xiǎo Lóng, Happy?  In answer, he rolled over and, belly up, looked at me, reached out a paw and stroked my cheek.  (London, UK, 1995)   "

  "body": "Chickens  The chick that got away  Next door neighbour, who’d only moved in a couple of years previously, when I was 10 or so, heard about our crocodiles and decided to copy us.  He was a police inspector, with a chauffeur, so he didn’t need the extra income surely? Just trying to outdo us, I bet. (There’s a term in Singlish [Singapore English], called KS, short for kia su in Hokkien (福建 Fújiàn), one of the southern Chinese dialects in Singapore — meaning afraid to lose , i.e., competitive.)  In my dialect, another southern Chinese dialect called Teochew (潮州 Cháozhōu), police inspector is called dwǎ gào \/ Big Dog .  So, Big Dog started building his own crocodile enclosure at the bottom of the garden, against the back garden wall. Instead of feeding them dead fish like we did, he gave them newly hatched live chicks — apparently, this makes them grow faster.  Every other day, a van would arrive. We’d hear the van run along their driveway, which was parallel to our common garden wall.  The garden partition used to be a hedge when we first moved in, in 1958. It was made up of mainly the common hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), called 大紅花 dà hóng huā \/ big red flower in Chinese.  We children would go and have endless fun at that hedge, catching spiders and big red ants, keeping them in matchboxes. With the red ants, we’d pull off their antennae, put them together in a bigger box, and watch them fight — without their feelers, ants can’t identify their own kind. Children can be terrible like that, getting pleasure out of such cruel pursuits.  As soon as he moved in, Big Dog tore down the hibiscus hedge and put up a forbidding brick wall, about 6 ft high. Like as if we’d spy on him and his family.  For some reason, Big Dog went for a brick wall with gaps in it rather than a solid one — the bricks were staggered at each level, giving a chequerboard effect. He should be rich enough not to have to worry about paying for a few more bricks, surely [meow]. He was obviously even more unsociable than the previous occupants — the eccentric mother-and-son team, building a wall that made sure we couldn’t look into their garden and house. Like as if we had nothing better to do.  The van comes to a halt. You can hear the driver getting out. Opens the back doors. A wave of chirp chirp chirp chirp cheep cheep cheep cheep emanates from the other side of the garden wall.  The man pulls out one tray of chicks. Walks from the back of the van to the crocodile enclosure. Tips the tray over the side of the enclosure wall. He goes back for another tray. The whole process is repeated until all the chicks have been dispatched. Man shuts the rear doors of his van. Drives off.  The chirp chirp chirp chirp cheep cheep cheep cheep becomes chirp chirp chirp cheep cheep cheep . Then chirp chirp cheep cheep . Then chirp cheep . Then silence.  Lucky, then, for one chick that Big Dog didn’t construct a solid brick wall. It was through one of those gaps in the wall that one day, one of the chicks intended for Big Dog’s crocodiles fled over to our side. It must’ve jumped ship as the delivery van man pulled out the tray or was carrying it to the croc enclosure.  We decided not to give it back to him.  Once the chick was old enough to live in the open, it was given the soursop tree to perch on. (Soursop: Annona muricata, also called graviola, guyabano and, in Hispanic America, guanábana. We call it “Western durian” in my dialect, maybe because of its spikes.)  When it was big enough, we decided to spare it from the cooking pot, for it’d become more like a pet really, although there wasn’t much interaction between us. (We didn’t interact much either with the crocodiles, or the tortoise, or the canaries, or the crow, or the guinea pig, or the tropical fish, or the monkey.)  We later came to regret this act of mercy, however, for the chick turned out to be a rooster.  The soursop tree was outside my bedroom, at the end of the annex block that my mother added to house us five children, when I was about nine. It was bad enough for it to be crowing early in the morning when you wanted just an extra few minutes of sleep, but in its old age, it’d crow at the oddest of hours, getting earlier and earlier: from 5 am to 4 am, then 3 am, then even 2 am, or anytime it felt like it.  I used to shout at him from my bed, Should’ve eaten you ages ago!  It eventually died of old age.  Now, at my own ripe old age and not always with it, I feel bad about having shouted at him. I wonder if he’d taken all those threats of mine to heart and decided to die before he found himself on our dinner table. Oops, did he die of a heart attack, worrying about being dinner…? Oh dear.  (Singapore, 1960s)   An eggsperiment  (This first appeared as a journal entry, then a blog.)  The details are being hatched.  (France, September\/October 2011)   Update 280112 : It’s been a long incubation, getting this blog hatched.  I’d been cutting greens (found out much later they were alfalfa) for the rabbits, whose hutches are within the same enclosure as the hens.  I would immediately, while still in the field, conscientiously pick off the minute escargots that clung to the stems and leaves. On one occasion, just as I was about to feed the greens to the rabbits, I noticed that I’d missed out on a couple of escargots, so I picked them off and threw them onto the ground, which were instantly pounced upon by the hens.  It set me thinking that the hens might welcome the change in their usual diet of grain and vegetable scraps from the kitchen, and the escargot shell would provide the calcium for eggshell-making.  Previous offerings of normal size escargots were left untouched. I think it’s because they were too big for the hens to handle: shell too hard to break into, flesh too big and tough to pick at.  Besides, even if I couldn’t make much of a dent in the escargot population, it might help save some of the wooden boundary posts. The chap in the village was complaining only the other day that they chomp through his fence posts at an alarming rate. He came back from a few days away to find his flower population decimated.  The next foray into the field saw me equipped with not just the bucket and knife for the greens, but also a big plastic yoghurt tub and teaspoon for the escargots. The teaspoon is for scooping up any escargot dropped, as it’s difficult to pick up the tiny pests with one’s fingers.  I soon discovered that another field was so densely populated with the creatures that, instead of picking them singly off each stalk of alfalfa or blade of grass, I could just pick up a dried thistle branch and shake off all the clingers-on into the plastic tub, or scrape huge clusters off the boundary posts, thus filling up the yoghurt tub within five minutes max and saving myself a lot of work.  I’d then approach the hen enclosure, rattling the tub to build up their eagerness in anticipation as part of the training (see also Pig training). Sure enough, the hens would pounce on the little tit-bits tossed over the fence, especially the turkeys who absolutely relished them.  My eggsperiment produced results within a day, much sooner than I’d expected. Jeanette reported egg production up by 50%. The 20 hens and turkeys would normally produce about eight eggs a day in the summer (daughter Isabelle said “down to a minimum in August\/September”), but after my twice-daily supply of escargots, we’d get 12 per day. In the end, we were giving the eggs away to people to thank them for their help: ploughing the fields and harvesting the crops when Jeanette was down with cancer a few years back.  Daughter Isabelle said snail diet was common during her grandparents’ time.  I will be repeating the eggsperiment this coming summer, just to make sure it wasn’t a coincidence, and report back. Watch this space!  (Gers, S.W. France, September\/October 2011)  Update September 2012: They’ve got wise! They’ve sussed out my ulterior motive in feeding them these little escargots, so they’ve begun shunning my efforts. Well, that’s the end to my mega egg-producing business dreams then.   The loner hen  (This first appeared as a blog.)  There is a motley collection of animals on the farm: cows, turkeys and chickens, rabbits, dogs and cats. (They used to have geese and ducks, too, but got rid of them after the mother had cancer.)  The cows are left out in the fields to graze, and would only come in if it is very cold in the winter, or be brought in the night before their vaccinations.  The dogs and cats are free to wander around outside, although most of their time in the summer is spent in a horizontal position in the shade (temperatures can get to 42˚C). Hard life being a dog or a cat, isn’t it.  The turkeys and chickens are kept in a corralled area at the back, in the same pen housing the rabbit hutches.  On one particular visit, I saw a lone hen running around the front of the farm house.  At the end of each day, an hour before sundown, farm mistress Jeanette would open the gate to the chicken and turkey enclosure, and let them wander around in the neighbouring ex-kitchen garden (moved to the rear, far side of the house). This is to give them a change of environment and activity, scrabbling for worms and the seeds of the amaranth (莧菜 xiàncài) which grows all over the countryside, treated by the French as a weed, but a common veg in the Chinese diet. So, I thought that the lone hen had broken loose from this area.  When I saw it a third time at the front of the house, I mentioned it to Jeanette, wondering if we should perhaps go and catch it.  It turned out that she (the hen, not Jeanette) hated being cooped up like the rest of her fowl folk, and kept breaking out. After the nth time of catching her and returning her to the corral, Jeanette decided to let her be. The hen never gave her any more trouble.  Jeanette’s husband Serge had left some bales of hay in the barn\/garage area for temporary storage. The hen took to laying an egg on top of one of the bales. After Serge removed the bales, she carried on laying her eggs there, straight onto the concrete floor, in the exact same spot where she’d been laying them thus far on the top of the bale. Habits do die hard even with hens, it seems.  The hen started to team up with Dino, adopted latecomer to the farm (see also Dino the dirty dog), staying close to him. They went everywhere together.  The sight of Dino the scruffy long-haired long-legged mottled black-grey dog (as against the short-haired short-legged brown hunting dogs on the farm) walking around the farm, followed everywhere by the one hen, was rather endearing and heart-warming — two socially awkward creatures who didn’t fit in with their own kind managing to build up an unlikely companionable relationship with each other.

Ah Ham used to hide surplus food: anything she couldn’t finish, she’d bury, to dig up later as late night supper, perhaps.  (Haha, even the dogs have Chinese habits! It’s common for the Chinese to have 宵夜 xiāo yè \/ late night snack, perhaps because they usually eat dinner around 6:30 \/ 7 pm, so they’d be hungry by 11 pm — if they’re still up. Where I grew up in a suburb in Singapore, we could go out at that late hour and get fried or soup noodles from some roadside stall to eat after a mahjong session.)  My uncle Kim, who lived on the coconut plantation with my grandma as he’s the older of her two sons, used to tell Ah Ham off for this unhygienic practice. (He was originally meant for medical school, and was very particular about hygiene.)  One day, Ah Ham had just finished burying a fish skeleton when Uncle Kim stepped out of the house. She quickly sat down, on all fours, on the spot, to hide the skeleton. Unfortunately, the burying — being interrupted — hadn’t been done properly, so half the fish skeleton stuck out of the ground from the side of her belly.  (Singapore, 1960s)  (Cultural note: southern Chinese tend to add Ah in front of mono-syllabic names, because the Chinese language doesn’t like unbalanced words. So, Peter would stay as Peter, but Pete would become Ah Pete.)   Aptly-named dog  (This first appeared as a blog.)  Being the slow thinker that I am, it’s only just dawned on me during this visit to the French farm just how aptly named Dino is, even though his deceased previous owner (a French farmer) very likely didn’t know any English. The ball of scruff has “din” in his name!  Dino takes up position just outside the kitchen door (at the side of the house) for that’s a most handy spot for being the first to get all the scraps.  As soon as he hears one of the other (six) dogs (stationed at the front of the house) bark, before he even gets a glimpse of what that dog might be barking at, he leaps straight into barking action, charging out to the front of the farm house, woofing with all his might but, as Jeanette mimes it to me, he has absolutely no clue what he’s barking about, glancing around him with a baffled look even while he’s barking furiously, wondering what he is supposed to be barking at or about. Often, he rushes up to Pastou (pronounced pa-tu), the old grandee of the dogs and his arch growling enemy, just barking at him instead. He seems to be joining in just for the sake of not wanting to be left out.  On this winter visit, I’ve had a few more opportunities to test out my theory (developed in September last year) about his having been beaten a lot before he came to the farmhouse.  My other entry Dino the dirty dog mentions his getting up immediately and moving away when you approach him, which smacks (ha! pun!) of his trying to avoid a beating or kicking.  This time, he was a lot more trusting of me, actually allowing me to go all the way up to him, and to pat and stroke his head. Quite an improvement, indeed, from when I first met him in the summer of 2010. (Update: summer 2012: he was actually following me around practically everywhere, which he used to do with Jeanette.) (Further update: Dino was actually competing with the little black cat when the latter came up to me for stroking!)  Once or twice during this winter stay, I’d had to restrain him by the scruff of his neck when I put out a dish of food scraps for the cats and he tried to muscle in. The high-pitched yelping and whining that he let out sounded like I’d trodden on his feet or whacked him really hard. To his credit, though, at least he did not try to disobey or bite me.  There’s hope yet, then, of training this wretched cur to understand that not every hand that reaches out towards him is for inflicting pain. Maybe at some point, we can get the “o” (zero [noise]) out of him rather than just the constant “din”.  (France, Dec 2011–Jan 2012)  from journal Tuesday 060911, 7.55 am  Talking of strange dogs: Dino has now actually overcome his risk-avoidance instincts and is competing with the little black cat (another new face) for stroking. The little black cat was practically head-butting my hand for stroking as I was positioning the 2 freeloaders (solar chargers for batteries and mobile phone) on the living\/dining room window sill. He [Dino] has not yet learned, however, from the other dogs that one doesn’t bark at one’s own family car — Jeanette went out 5 minutes ago in the car, and Dino’s barking alerted me to the imminent arrival of a car, although I couldn’t hear the engine. It’s only 8.05 am, so I reckoned it must be Jeanette returning and stood up to watch from the front window as Dino continued to bark, the only one to do so. Sure enough, about 10 seconds later, Jeanette’s car appeared. Even when he had full view of it, Dino still carried on barking, all the way until she parked it in the garage\/barn. I shall keep monitoring to see if there’s a pattern: maybe, being Dino and therefore does things totally differently, he’s barking to say hello, welcome back. Let’s see if he stays silent with visitors’ cars.  (Gers, S.W. France, 2010–12)   Dino the dirty dog (in more ways than one)  (This first appeared as a journal entry, then a blog.)  Dino is an ugly dog. Those were Colette’s first words to me about him, poor boy!  He doesn’t look anything like the other dogs on the farm, which are all hunting dogs, numbering at least half a dozen at any one time.  The hunting dogs are brown, short-legged, short-haired, extremely sociable and get on with everyone else, both four-legged and two-, looking you straight in the eye each time. There is one that bares its teeth as it waddles up to you, wagging its whole backside, which Colette said was meant to be a smile — the baring of teeth, that is, not the wagging of backside.  Dino, on the other hand, stands out for miles. The first impression is how scruffy he is. His matted, tangled long fur always has clumps of something embedded and he is always scratching. He is of an indeterminable shade of black and dark grey, has shifty eyes and wears a perpetual sheepish and apologetic look as if he’s just done something bad (which you have yet to discover).  He’ll get up and shuffle away on his long legs as soon as you approach, whether you’re going up to him or just passing by, as if he’s afraid of being targeted. The “just in case” approach. He must’ve been beaten a lot, probably for no reason, which might explain the perpetual sheepish look — he’s come to think he is always in the wrong.  He’d come to the farm as an orphan. His owner had died in a house fire, which had destroyed everything else but Dino.  Right from the start, Dino failed to fit in, by rubbing the other dogs up the wrong way — more specifically, up the wrong end by sniffing their underparts. They took umbrage at this newcomer taking such an over-familiar approach, and warned him off with a few growls at the back of the throat and some rising hackles. Which should’ve been clear to Dino, except that he doesn’t seem to read body language messages too well, and went ahead with his never-say-die way of doing things.  The growls would grow in volume and duration, then turn into bites, but still he’d go back for more. If one dog didn’t like his bum sniffed at, Dino would move on to the next, undeterred. Colette calls it sexual harassment.  In the end, Dino was left with the loner hen (see The loner hen) for company. They’d go for walks together, exploring various parts of the farm, until the loner hen got eaten one day — by one of the hunting dogs.  So Dino went back to bum-sniffing, which eventually erupted in a massive retaliation one day, as the other dogs sank their teeth into him and rolled him about in the mud. So that’s where he gets his matted fur from!  Farm mistress Jeanette is a real sweetie with people, very good natured and easy-going, but you hear her constantly barking at Dino, many times a day. Without looking out of the window, I’ll know from Jeanette’s ticking off that he’s either been doing some sniffing, or stealing some dog’s food.  He’s not perpetually hungry, though. One day I found him sitting down with a bun on the ground right in front of him. As soon as he saw me coming out of the house, he picked it up between his teeth and walked away from me. Fair enough, he thought I might want to take it from him. This happened every time I went anywhere near him. However, hours later, that bun was still uneaten. So he was just guarding it for the sake of stopping anyone from taking it from him. Strange dog.  On my way back to London, as the plane was landing, I heard a hoarse raspy sound, a throaty sort of woof woof that was Dino’s bark. He had stowed away and was following me back! It turned out to be the speed brakes of the landing plane rasping.  Caught a bus from where the airport bus dropped me near Olympia, and as it approached South Kensington Tube station, lo and behold, right ahead was a huge sign that I’d never noticed before, which said DINO’s [Italian restaurant]. No escape from the ball of scruff even back in London.  Update (October 2011): Coming back on Monday 03 October from my visit to the farm this summer, I took the same bus via South Kensington as last year, and found that Dino’s has now become Muriel’s Kitchen. Wonder if it’s because they’d read my blog above and didn’t want to be associated with a ball of scruff...?  (Gers, S.W. France, 2011)   The dog who came for a break  On a(nother) visit to the French farm one year, I was greeted by a small black dog, barking furiously at me from the sofa where he had been dozing comfortably.  I knew it didn’t belong to the farm because the farm dogs were:   all hunting dogs and brown;  always friendly and happy to see me, even at the first meeting — sometimes too friendly, putting their front paws on my shoulders and walking forwards with me if I tried to make them drop their paws by stepping back;  bigger than this small yappy thing;  not allowed in the house, never mind actually get onto the sofa, let alone dozing, and comfortably to boot — unthinkable.   They said this dog was from Lasseran, the neighbouring village on the parallel ridge to the north. He was stressed out from his home environment as his owners had lots of boisterous children, so his owners brought him to the farm for some peace and quiet.  A couple of days later, I noticed he was not around. They said he’d gone back, as he’d de-stressed enough from his stay on the farm.  A day later, I saw him coming back, trotting across the fields.  So, he’d come back to his spiritual retreat for another stay. And this time, he knew how to get to the farm himself.  (Gers, S.W. France 2012)   The dog with no common sense  I arrived one summer at the French farm to find a new canine addition to the house. The dogs and cats on the farm were banned from the house.  Farm mistress Jeanette would loudly shoo them out if she caught them, waving her arms wildly about and stamping her feet. She’s a kind soul, so I think she does it more to get a laugh out of seeing the frantic scrabbling about of claws on the floor tiles.  This new dog was not only indoors, but actually sleeping on the living room floor, lying horizontally in the middle of the path from the front door of the living room through to the kitchen, so that one had to walk around it, or step over it, as it simply refused to budge. That is, if one didn't trip over one of its outstretched legs or something and land right on top of it.  What a strange spot to choose to be in a horizontal position: more effort involved in trying to get out of the way as he would have to get up fully — that is, if he was trying to get out of the way, which this dog obviously wasn’t bothered about.  That encounter was in the afternoon.  I mentioned this to Serge and Jeanette, and was told that the dog’s owner had brought it to the farm for them to look after as it had a leg injury. No wonder it got a leg injury, with such positioning sense, I thought.  The following morning, I came across it at 8 am when I went to the loo at the back of the house, this time sleeping slap bang in the doorway between the kitchen and the loo\/bathroom part of the house.  This was even more stupid, as there was no room around it, and whoever going to the loo in the middle of the night could very well walk straight into it. I had to step carefully over it as, once again, it simply ignored me and stayed put.  A bit later, on my way back from brushing my teeth in the bathroom (opposite the loo), I saw that the dog had now edged over to the upright bread bin sitting beside the doorway, with its head tilted, leaning against the side of the bread bin, eyes shut.  The bread bin is really a 3ft-high narrow laundry basket, made of plastic with big holes, converted into a bread bin because it is the right length for French baguettes and its holes provide the ventilation for them.  I thought it was unhygienic that the dog’s head should be right next to the baguettes, separated only by the holey plastic, so I moved the bin away. The dog’s head remained at that leaning angle in the air, for some 30 seconds before it lowered it to the floor in slow motion. It was like I was standing in frozen time.  Another strange dog. (The farm is full of eccentric creatures, even the temporary visitors — four- and two-legged.)  (Gers, S.W. France, 2011)   Keeping in touch with your dog  (This first appeared as a blog.)  My Italian student has brought her father over to London after his operation, so that she can keep an eye on him for a few months. He has a girlfriend but lives alone in Bari in south Italy.  He does not speak English and has no friends here. His daughter, son-in-law and grandson are out all day at work or at school, so he’s bored and has been talking about going home.  He also misses his dog. I suggested that he could get his friend, who is looking after the dog for him, to use Skype for him to see his dog on the screen and talk to it.  This idea of mine has come from having witnessed, on more than one occasion, the reaction of family pet dogs and cats to what’s on the TV screen. Some will get frightened by the violent animal action on the screen (e.g., a lion chasing its prey); some fascinated. Others will go behind the set to look for the animals they see in the programme.  Success! My student reported last week that the dog recognised the master on the screen and got very excited.  Now we just need to teach the dog to go on Skype itself, so that the friend needn’t be troubled each time.  Update a week later: My student said the dog’s now even pawing at the screen to try and touch the master’s face.  (London\/Italy, 2015)   Minou  The cats and dogs on the French farm are not allowed into the house at all, yet on one of my earlier visits some 15 years ago, I found this rule flouted by a black and white cat — either a young adult or an old kitten, I couldn’t tell, as it was small in size and young in appearance. I’ve never been good at telling the age of humans anyway, so it’s even harder with animals. I see the soul, not the shell.  Soon, I could see why this cat was granted special dispensation: he had very winning ways. He wasn’t just good-looking (it’s so unfair, isn’t it?!?), he was also very obliging: lying on his side, he’d allow le patron Serge or Colette to twirl him round and round on the spot, without the slightest protest or indignation, happily basking in the attention. He was always handed bits of food from the dining table as he would beg most charmingly. Not grovel; just beg.  Colette would coo to him whenever she saw him, Minou, Minou, Minou! so I assumed that was his name. Then one day, I heard Colette’s mother Jeanette call him Mimi .  Mimi?!? I thought his name was Minou? And Mimi for a tom?? Ah well, it’s a foreign language to me, so maybe Mimi is all right as a name for a boy in French. Like Michel, which sounds just like Michelle to me. The French do things differently anyway.  Some ten years later, on another visit of mine, we were invited round to the house of relatives of theirs, for a pre-Tour de France meal before going out to cheer them on as they whizzed through the village. This was a couple in their 60s, if not 70s. Imagine my surprise, then, when I heard the wife address the husband as Minou . I guess if Felix works as a name for both male cat and male human in English, why not Minou in French? When I commented on it, she explained that Minou sort of meant darling .  Ah, the penny then dropped: Mimi is an abbreviation of Minou, reduplicated. From that minute on, I started calling him Monsieur Minou, which amused them heaps, but it has stuck since then, with everyone knowing him as Monsieur Minou. Lucky for him I didn’t choose to use the abbreviated version…  I have since looked it up in the dictionary. Minou means pussycat, as well as my sweetie .  (Gers, S.W. France, 1990s)   The super goalkeeper  (This was a journal entry, then a blog.)  I’m staying in a tiny village, St. Amans, in Tarn et Garonne (NE of Toulouse), in a bohemian house. Three cats. One dog.  When I first arrived and was shown into the living room, a growl emanated from this shaggy black and white dog on the floor. My first thought, Oh, she doesn’t like me.   Found a couple of fig trees in the garden, so I decided to pick the ripened fruit, rather than let it go to waste. Especially since the occupants of the house are all on what we call zero-hours contract in Britain, i.e., temporary work, which is usually menial, like bar-tending. I like climbing trees, too, as a tomboy, and haven’t had much opportunity for that in London.  The black and white dog Kali came and stood under the tree to watch. My childhood chum Boo Bear the Alsatian used to eat any fruit (except banana), so I offered one to Kali, caught deftly and wolfed down in half a second. Thereafter, Kali got at least a 20% share of my pickings, never missing any of the figs thrown her way. She’s certainly not going to get goitre at this rate.  Fig-picking done, I decided to play ball with Kali in the large garden, at first throwing, later kicking, and discovered she is a SUPER goalie.  Even as you're adjusting your foot — one tiny fraction of an inch to the left or right; or half circle; or full circle to face the opposite direction — she'll immediately jerk her head and body in that direction, or run around to the other side, in anticipation of your being about to kick the (tennis) ball that way.  No matter how many times you do this to try and wrong-foot her before you actually kick the ball, she responds instantly and tirelessly every single time, all the way until you actually kick it. (And after all that, I'm such a useless footballer that the ball doesn't get very far…)  In the middle of my first night there, I decided at 3 am to go out and look at the night sky, as there’s no light pollution there. The sky over the French farm in Gers offers the most spectacular views of the Milky Way and lots of shooting stars.  Emerging from my ground floor bedroom in the wing of the house, I found Kali sitting outside the door, with the ball on the floor in front of her, waiting for me to go and play ball! At 3 am!  Kali is 11 or 12 years old. Google says, “Depending on the breed and size of the dog, 10 to 12 years is considered late middle age and the beginning of the elderly years.” Wow, a near-elderly goalkeeper, and so sharp as well at that age!  It suddenly occurred to me as I was writing up the blog about her that Kali is a sheep dog. No wonder! Her reactions to my foot movements are like how a sheep dog would react to the slightest movements of the sheep while trying to herd them in a particular direction or into the corral.  In the 1964 Disney musical Mary Poppins, the nanny invented a word for the children: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.  I’m now shortening it and applying it to this wonder goalie dog: Super Kali.  (Tarn, S.W. France, 2018)   They don’t bark at family  One of the things I noticed during an early stay on the French farm was: Jeanette didn’t look up at the sound of every approaching car.  The farm is on a ridge parallel to, and north of, the Pyrénées, with a good view of the mountain range when the atmospheric pressure is right. They are hidden from view most of the time, so that you can’t even tell they are there. If they are fully visible in their snow-topped glory, then it’ll rain the next day (or so).  The nearest neighbours are: Jean-Louis and Josianne 1km away down by the A21, the main road leading to the Pyrénées; and also 1km away in the other direction, the village idiot and his brother and sister-in-law further inland. Only the postman would drive up to the house. Or the neighbours, or friends and relatives, maybe the occasional first-time visitor — to buy wood from Serge’s little sawmill.  For a farm that is out on a limb, they get quite a few visitors, so popular and hospitable are they. This means more cars being driven up to the house than its secluded location would otherwise attract.  As is the case with almost everything on this farm, the dogs behave differently from the rest of the canine world beyond its boundaries, it seems: they only bark at outsiders. So, if one can hear a car pulling up and the dogs (and there were nine of them at one point) don’t bark, it is someone known to the family. How they manage to remember which car sound is a new one (to them), I shall never know.  Even though I only went once a year, during the long summer school holidays, the dogs remembered me every subsequent year.  On my very first visit during the Easter break in 1996, I’d arrived at midnight, having taken the Eurostar to Paris, then the TGV all the way to Agen, and then an hour-long bus journey to Auch, 6 kms from the farm, being met there by Jeanette, the farm mistress.  As I stepped out of the car, I found myself surrounded by six dogs who emerged suddenly out of the dark, even at that late hour.  One of them, Pastou Ironically, Google says: The term “pastou” (pronounced patou) is derived from the word “pastre”, meaning shepherd in old French and designates a shepherd's dog as it was understood in times past. Unlike a herd dog, the role of the guard dog is not to drive the sheep but rather to protect them from wild animals or feral dogs. (pronounced pa-tu ), stood up on his hind legs and put his front paws on my shoulders. I stepped back to try and make him drop his paws, but he just walked forwards with me as I stepped back. That was my first reception.  After that day, I got to know the dogs: Patoche (meaning paw ), Fleurie… All hunting dog. All brown and short-haired. And short-legged.  On my visit in 2012, I was invited out by a British girl who’d married a local man down the road. We went into town: to the market, to the little museum, then for a coffee. After that, we went back to her place for dinner and a chat, before she drove me back to the farm around 11 pm.  Serge and Jeanette go to bed around 9 pm, so I asked her to drop me off at the bottom of the last stretch of the drive up, so that the dogs’ barking wouldn’t disturb the sleeping human occupants. I had a wind-up torch on me, but I didn’t need it as there was a full moon.  It wasn’t until I reached the front door of the farm house that I realised the dogs had not barked at all throughout the 100-yard walk up the drive. It was dark, they only see me once a year, yet they somehow knew it was me — they presumably had a mental record of my footsteps (from the daytime), rather than the sound of a car engine. Amazing.  I felt so honoured — to have been accepted by the dogs as family!  (Gers, S.W. France, 1990s)   "

One day, she asked me to look after her goldfish, as she was going away on holiday in Spain for a fortnight. She said I had to feed it twice a day — once in the morning and once in the evening, and also change its water at least once a week. When changing its water, I was to take the fish out and put it in a cup of clean water, clean out the bowl and change the water, then put the fish back.  After Carol left, every time I went into her room to feed the fish, it would dart around the bowl madly as I approached it. Each time I’d think, I’m supposed to be feeding this fish to keep it alive, but it might well die of a heart attack at the rate it’s going!  It was even worse changing its water. The fish would frantically dodge my attempts to pick it up (to put it in a cup of water), and it would take me ages to catch it. I would get quite wet in the process as well. I was beginning to get really worried about presenting Carol with a dead fish upon her return.  One day in Week Two, I was just leaving the house — all geared up for cycling in to work — when I realised I’d forgotten to feed the fish, so I went back into the house. As I approached the fish bowl, there was not a single movement from the fish. For a moment, I thought it was dead.  When I got right up to the bowl, I saw that it was still alive. I wondered why it didn’t dart around like it always did whenever I went up to feed it.  Then I realised that I was wearing an orange cagoule A wind-cheater \/ waterproof jacket. . The little goldfish must’ve thought I was its mummy!  (London, UK, 1983)   "

  "body": "Horses  Duchess the Exmoor mare  The Conoco London Friday-pubbing group decided to hire a self-drive mini-bus and take off to Exmoor in Devon, SW England, for a healthy — ahem, before dark only — weekend horse-riding.  The first step on the first morning involved getting us paired up with our own horses. Being the smallest in the group (I’m already quite small among Orientals, never mind among Westerners), the smallest horse they could find for me was a mare called Duchess.  There was something about her I didn’t like, particularly the look in her eyes.  She was still a bit too big for me: they had to get me a stool to stand on just to get my foot into the stirrup. Even then, one of the grooms had to give my derrière a shove to heave me up into the saddle.  We were taught the rudiments: how to hold the reins; how to raise our backsides — up down, up down, up down — in time with the horse’s clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop, which is actually quite hard work, requiring strong leg muscles.  Finally, we were ready to leave the stable yard, led by a guiding groom. Within no time at all, we left the open road and entered a forested area.  I very soon found out that my mare was Duchess by name, and Duchess by nature.  While the other horses followed the path between the pine trees, Duchess decided to show me who was boss. (She must’ve sensed my nervousness in the stable yard. I understand that animals can sense, or smell, that you’re afraid of them.) She took me through the trees, with branches sticking out horizontally, some coming down to my face level. Branches she’d walked through (and thus pushed forward) would whip back and scratch my face.  Worse, around my neck, I had a Pentax camera with a metal lens cap, unfortunately not attached to the camera by a cord — like how skis are to the ankles, in case one falls over and the skis unclip, so that they don’t go careering down the slopes. One of those pine tree branches also whipped my lens cap off, so I lost that for good, as I couldn’t go back for it, unaided (to get me off, then back on, the horse) — besides, the others were on the path, a distance away.  At the end of that wooded section, we emerged into an open field. One of the riders suddenly spurred his horse on, and went into a gallop. All the other horses immediately followed suit, including Duchess.  Problem was: I’d only been taught a short while ago how to stay in the saddle at a walking pace, and was just about managing that.  As Duchess charged forth to keep up with the other horses, I clung on to the horn of the saddle with all my life.  All of a sudden, Duchess came to a dead halt, nearly catapulting me over her head. Lurching forward, my face was almost buried in her mane. I grasped big handfuls of hair — hers, not mine.  Then, she lowered her head as if to nibble at the grass, pitching me even further forwards.  Just as I was congratulating myself for not sliding down her neck, she turned her head round to face my left foot, and bared her teeth just inches away from my toes.  That was when I gave up trying to be brave, and cried out, “Help me, help me!” Duchess looked up and gave me a withering look, “What are you on about, you silly girl!”  It turned out she was just trying to scratch an itch in that part of her neck.  I am convinced, though, to this day that she knew how scared I was of her right from the start, and decided to have some fun with this total novice.  (Devon, UK, 1977)   Manis the Malang pony  I was private tutor variously to some Indonesian teenagers whose parents were either related or good friends, and also rich enough to send the children to Singapore for their education.  They kept saying to me, You must come to Indonesia, and we’ll show you around our country! So I went in December 1973 (which is Singapore’s equivalent of the end-of-school-year long summer break in the West, as the school year starts on 02 January — being in the tropics at 1˚N, it has no discernible seasons, just dry or rainy, or hot, very hot, unbearably hot).  With it being the school holidays, train tickets from Jakarta to Bali were all sold out, but we managed to join a package tour which happened to have four vacancies going.  The route was overland from Jakarta to Bali and back, out along the northern part of the island of Java, and back along the southern part of Java. One of the places nearer the eastern end of Java was Malang, our last stop before Surabaya where we’d be crossing over to Bali by ferry.  Malang is up in the hills, rather like Cameron Highlands near Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, so it’s pleasantly cool (particularly appealing for a tropics-bred girl). I saw apples on the trees (instead of in the market) for the very first time in my life.  I also rode a horse for the first time in my life. There wasn’t much to do in Malang, so the tour guide arranged for us to have a horse-riding experience on the morning of our departure.   Horse sitting is more appropriate a term: we were helped onto our own horses by our respective grooms (yes, one groom per rider!), who then walked alongside us, holding on to the reins, as we wove our way through a forested patch.  Being only 5ft 1in (1.55m) in height, I was given the smallest horse — a mare called Manis. Manis means sweet in Indonesian (and Malay), and she was indeed sweet: docile and gentle in temperament.  At the end of the trek through the forest, we came out into the open, to the bottom of the road rising up the gradient to our hotel.  A chap in my group on the biggest steed suddenly shouted, “Race you!” and charged off up the slope. Manis took up the challenge on my behalf and gave chase. And overtook that big horse!  Judge not a horse by its size.  (Malang, Java, Indonesia, December 1973)   "

  "body": "Monkeys  Mietsy the monkey  (This first appeared as a blog.)  My father came home one day with a monkey, whom we named Mietsy.  I can’t remember who came up with the name (which sounds like merci in French), nor on what basis. Probably my eldest sister, who was the creative one when it came to party ideas and fun things. We had a dog named Boo Bear (after cartoon character Yogi Bear’s sidekick), another called Skopje (which we used to pronounce as skop-jay until years later when I discovered it is skop-yay, the place in [the former] Yugoslavia).  Mietsy lived in the fig tree next to the garage (just a roof, no walls), onto which my brother’s room opened.  My mother had got an annexe put in to house us five children. It comprised four spaces in a row: a big bedroom in the middle for my eldest sister and second sister, a smaller one at one end for my third sister and me, the smallest at the other end for my brother, opening onto the last space (with no walls) for the family car.  My brother had a bunch of mates who came round constantly to our house, chilling out in his room, listening to music, then going off to some roadside stalls for a late-night snack (fried or soup noodles, or something).  They were all born in the same year — 1950, which is the year of the tiger, so they called themselves the Tiger Club.  One day, the Tiger Club returned from a fun fair at which they’d won a bottle of whiskey from the Ring A Prize stall. The make was Duck Brand, and it tasted foul — well, what do you expect of a whiskey named after a fowl? So, after a sip each, they gave it to Mietsy, who happily lapped it all up.  Soon, he started to feel drowsy and tried to climb onto his sleeping space in the fig tree. It was only about two feet above ground in the tree trunk where all the major branches forked, thus providing a broad roosting place. It was as if the two feet of tree trunk had been greased over with anti-climb: Mietsy kept slipping and sliding down. In the end, after a few more attempts, he gave up and went to sleep at the base of the tree, on the ground. (Singapore is very hot, even at night, so there was no danger of him catching a chill.)  The next morning, we found him sitting in the same spot where he’d gone to sleep, with both arms wrapped around his head, nursing a hangover. Poor monkey.  (Singapore, 1960s)   Monkey training  (This first appeared as a blog.)  We had just re-turfed our lawn with what we called “carpet grass”, a fine-blade variety that felt like a thick-pile carpet to the eye and to the derrière. This is presumably what the modern astro turf is based on.  My uncle had a lawn planted with this grass, so we got a block of it from him, split it up into little strips, each about six inches long, and planted them at regular intervals. The idea was to wait for them to grow sideways and eventually meet.  In the meantime, however, weeds would colonise the gaps in between, so all hands were called to the deck to remove them.  After a few weeks of this back-breaking work, my father thought, “Monkeys can be trained to pick coconuts, so why not to weed the lawn?” (Yes, that’s the father with the eccentric ideas.)  He put Mietsy to the task: led him to the lawn, pulled out a few weeds himself as a demo, and said to him, See? This is how you do it. Now you do it.   To his credit, Mietsy actually seemed to understand what was expected of him, and did gamely try to emulate and please his master. Unfortunately, his horticultural knowledge didn’t extend to the finer distinctions between green bits that were weeds and green bits that were the much-prized carpet grass, so he pulled up the whole lot.  My father’s yelling and shouting could be heard from across the road. That free labour project was abandoned.  The idea itself, however, wasn’t totally discarded. One of my brother’s Tiger Club mates, Michael, decided to save himself the trouble of having to climb up our rambutan Rambutan: A red hairy fruit that grows in the tropics: mostly the size of a large egg, hairy skin, the inside is like a lychee but firmer and less fragrant; the tree is about the size and height of an apple tree (about 10–15 ft in height at most). tree to get the fruit. After all, like my father said, monkeys could be trained to pick coconuts, so why not rambutans?  So he took Mietsy to the tree, and following my father’s lead, pointed up the tree and said to Mietsy, There you are, Mietsy. Here’s the tree. Up there are the rambutans. Go and fetch them!   Mietsy duly went up the tree, and Michael sat back under the tree, waiting to collect the fruits of Mietsy’s labour.  A few minutes went by and no Mietsy re-appeared. Michael thought, He must be busy with so many bunches of rambutan to collect, give him a few more minutes.  Then, rambutan skin started to rain down on Michael’s head.  Michael looked up to find Mietsy sitting comfortably up in the branches, stuffing his face (literally, into his cheek pouches) with rambutans. To add insult to injury, he chucked the rambutan skin down at Michael. Luckily for Michael, it wasn’t a coconut tree. (Rambutans have a soft, thin skin, similar to lychees.)  That training programme also died an early death.  (Singapore, late 1960s)   "

  "body": "Pigs  Pig training  (This first appeared as a blog.)  For the first time since I began visiting the French farm in 1996, I didn’t have to rush back to London for the start of the academic year in September, so I overlapped with the pigs.  I’d always known about — and benefited from, when I arrived in the summer — the homemade sausages, ham and pâté. This time, the two pigs arrived a couple of weeks before my departure for London, so I got the chance to help look after them.  They were a yearly winter joint project, shared among the farm mistress, the neighbour down the road, and a friend on the other side of the main road down to Tarbes in the Pyrénées. As the farm has the space, the pigs would be housed there, until they were ready for the dinner table. When the time came, the men would come and take them away to be slaughtered, then brought back for turning into sausages, ham and pâté, which will get shared out.  I undertook to feed them — with the kitchen scraps and the vegetable garden rejects, as well as acorns, which they love, as a treat.  There were oak trees around the farm, so it became a daily routine for me to go and pick them, every few hours. Just like my twice-daily trips to a field to pick alfalfa for the rabbits. These little chores, in addition to bringing in the logs for the two stoves, harvesting or planting the broad beans, etc., gave me a purpose to my days, as well as providing a complete change from my London life as a teacher and translator, sitting at the computer most of the time. I’ve found my own spiritual retreat while helping to take some of the workload off their shoulders.  The pig pen is one half of a two-room shed some 50 yards from the farm house. (The other half is for locking up whichever of the hunting dogs is the problematic one, to isolate it from the rest of the pack.)  Only the bottom half of the shed door is in place, so it’s open for the top half, rather like a stable door.  On the first few feeding trips, I’d just walk up to the pen in silence. My raising the bucket to throw the contents over the half door would catch the pigs by surprise, and their violent shuddering and loud snorting would, in turn, catch me by surprise and make me jump (with no snorting).  I decided to train the pigs to get used to me before one of us had a heart attack.  About 15 feet (5 metres) from the pen, I’d start calling out, in a lilting musical voice (which I assumed would be soothing and friendly): H-e-y, p-i-g-s. It’s m-e-e-e!   Sure enough, no startled violent shuddering and loud snorting. It worked every single time after that.  I was starting to feel very pleased with myself for having come up with the idea of training the pigs.  Soon after, however, I discovered that I could’ve saved myself and the pigs all this fright by dropping off the food the right way.  In the back wall are two holes cut out at the bottom, with one ground-level concrete trough in each opening, half of which sticks into the pig enclosure and the other half out of the pen into the adjoining barn.  One just goes into the barn, stands on the barn side of the wall and drops the food into the troughs. The pigs will approach from their side and stick their snouts into their respective troughs. All very civilised, if a bit noisy — pigs like to express their appreciation and pleasure by grunting as they feed.  No chucking the food all over the floor for the pigs to find.  No raising the bucket above shoulder level, which was probably what frightened the living daylights out of them in the first place.  The other thing about feeding the pigs my original, ignoramus way is that in its eagerness, one of the pigs would greet me by rearing up and putting its front trotters on the half stable door, with its huge head at a level that’s easily above mine, and grunt at me — which is all quite scary if you’re a five-foot-tall townie. Feeding them through the troughs eliminated this over-enthusiastic welcome.  And finally, I also often ended up tipping some of the contents over the pigs themselves, so they'd be left with bits of vegetable and kitchen scraps trailing all over their backs and heads.  Poor pigs, having to put up with this pretend peasant!  So, who needed training after all? The pigs? Or the pig-feeder?!?  (Gers, S.W. France, 2011)   "

Theories abound as to what it was doing there, so far away from its natural habitat.  Four months on, it’s still there. A recent newspaper report says it looks like it’s decided to make the Thames its playground .  When it first appeared, people gave it the name of Benny (presumably to sort-of alliterate with beluga ?).  BBC’s Radio 4 has a weekly current affairs quiz show, called The News Quiz, with celebrities making up the two teams. They insert witty side comments, injecting light-heartedness into what would otherwise be a dry show, so it’s more an entertainment programme than a real test of the participants’ knowledge of the latest happenings.  The week Benny the beluga whale appeared in the Thames, this piece of news was, naturally, one of the items.  A male participant asked, Why the name Benny? How does one know it’s a male?  A female participant’s immediate response was, Because it got lost, but wouldn’t ask for directions!   (London, 2018)   "
