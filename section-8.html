</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-371">Grandma had an Alsatian on her coconut plantation, called Ah Ham.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-372">(Don’t know who had named her Ham or why.) Ah Ham used to hide surplus food: anything she couldn’t finish, she’d bury, to dig up later as late night supper, perhaps.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-373">(Haha, even the dogs have Chinese habits! It’s common for the Chinese to have 宵夜 xiāo yè / late night snack, perhaps because they usually eat dinner around 6:30 / 7 pm, so they’d be hungry by 11 pm — if they’re still up. Where I grew up in a suburb in Singapore, we could go out at that late hour and get fried or soup noodles from some roadside stall to eat after a mahjong session.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-374">My uncle Kim, who lived on the coconut plantation with my grandma as he’s the older of her two sons, used to tell Ah Ham off for this unhygienic practice. (He was originally meant for medical school, and was very particular about hygiene.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-375">One day, Ah Ham had just finished burying a fish skeleton when Uncle Kim stepped out of the house. She quickly sat down, on all fours, on the spot, to hide the skeleton. Unfortunately, the burying — being interrupted — hadn’t been done properly, so half the fish skeleton stuck out of the ground from the side of her belly.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-376">(Singapore, 1960s)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-377">(Cultural note: southern Chinese tend to add Ah in front of mono-syllabic names, because the Chinese language doesn’t like unbalanced words. So, Peter would stay as Peter, but Pete would become Ah Pete.)</div></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-18"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<div class="para" id="p-378">(This first appeared as a blog.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-379">Being the slow thinker that I am, it’s only just dawned on me during this visit to the French farm just how aptly named Dino is, even though his deceased previous owner (a French farmer) very likely didn’t know any English. The ball of scruff has “din” in his name!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-380">Dino takes up position just outside the kitchen door (at the side of the house) for that’s a most handy spot for being the first to get all the scraps.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-381">As soon as he hears one of the other (six) dogs (stationed at the front of the house) bark, before he even gets a glimpse of what that dog might be barking at, he leaps straight into barking action, charging out to the front of the farm house, woofing with all his might but, as Jeanette mimes it to me, he has absolutely no clue what he’s barking about, glancing around him with a baffled look even while he’s barking furiously, wondering what he is supposed to be barking at or about. Often, he rushes up to Pastou (pronounced pa-tu), the old grandee of the dogs and his arch growling enemy, just barking at <em class="alert">him</em> instead. He seems to be joining in just for the sake of not wanting to be left out.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-382">On this winter visit, I’ve had a few more opportunities to test out my theory (developed in September last year) about his having been beaten a lot before he came to the farmhouse.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-383">My other entry Dino the dirty dog mentions his getting up immediately and moving away when you approach him, which smacks (ha! pun!) of his trying to avoid a beating or kicking.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-384">This time, he was a lot more trusting of me, actually allowing me to go all the way up to him, and to pat and stroke his head. Quite an improvement, indeed, from when I first met him in the summer of 2010. (Update: summer 2012: he was actually following me around practically everywhere, which he used to do with Jeanette.) (Further update: Dino was actually competing with the little black cat when the latter came up to me for stroking!)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-385">Once or twice during this winter stay, I’d had to restrain him by the scruff of his neck when I put out a dish of food scraps for the cats and he tried to muscle in. The high-pitched yelping and whining that he let out sounded like I’d trodden on his feet or whacked him really hard. To his credit, though, at least he did not try to disobey or bite me.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-386">There’s hope yet, then, of training this wretched cur to understand that not every hand that reaches out towards him is for inflicting pain. Maybe at some point, we can get the “o” (zero [noise]) out of him rather than just the constant “din”.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-387">(France, Dec 2011–Jan 2012)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-388">from journal Tuesday 060911, 7.55 am</div>
<div class="para" id="p-389">Talking of strange dogs: Dino has now actually overcome his risk-avoidance instincts and is competing with the little black cat (another new face) for stroking. The little black cat was practically head-butting my hand for stroking as I was positioning the 2 freeloaders (solar chargers for batteries and mobile phone) on the living/dining room window sill. He [Dino] has not yet learned, however, from the other dogs that one doesn’t bark at one’s own family car — Jeanette went out 5 minutes ago in the car, and Dino’s barking alerted me to the imminent arrival of a car, although I couldn’t hear the engine. It’s only 8.05 am, so I reckoned it must be Jeanette returning and stood up to watch from the front window as Dino continued to bark, the only one to do so. Sure enough, about 10 seconds later, Jeanette’s car appeared. Even when he had full view of it, Dino still carried on barking, all the way until she parked it in the garage/barn. I shall keep monitoring to see if there’s a pattern: maybe, being Dino and therefore does things totally differently, he’s barking to say hello, welcome back. Let’s see if he stays silent with visitors’ cars.</div>

</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-391">(This first appeared as a journal entry, then a blog.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-392">“Dino is an ugly dog.” Those were Colette’s first words to me about him, poor boy!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-393">He doesn’t look anything like the other dogs on the farm, which are all hunting dogs, numbering at least half a dozen at any one time.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-394">The hunting dogs are brown, short-legged, short-haired, extremely sociable and get on with everyone else, both four-legged and two-, looking you straight in the eye each time. There is one that bares its teeth as it waddles up to you, wagging its whole backside, which Colette said was meant to be a smile — the baring of teeth, that is, not the wagging of backside.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-395">Dino, on the other hand, stands out for miles. The first impression is how scruffy he is. His matted, tangled long fur always has clumps of something embedded and he is always scratching. He is of an indeterminable shade of black and dark grey, has shifty eyes and wears a perpetual sheepish and apologetic look as if he’s just done something bad (which you have yet to discover).</div>
<div class="para" id="p-396">He’ll get up and shuffle away on his long legs as soon as you approach, whether you’re going up to him or just passing by, as if he’s afraid of being targeted. The “just in case” approach. He must’ve been beaten a lot, probably for no reason, which might explain the perpetual sheepish look — he’s come to think he is always in the wrong.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-397">He’d come to the farm as an orphan. His owner had died in a house fire, which had destroyed everything else but Dino.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-398">Right from the start, Dino failed to fit in, by rubbing the other dogs up the wrong way — more specifically, up the wrong end by sniffing their underparts. They took umbrage at this newcomer taking such an over-familiar approach, and warned him off with a few growls at the back of the throat and some rising hackles. Which should’ve been clear to Dino, except that he doesn’t seem to read body language messages too well, and went ahead with his never-say-die way of doing things.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-399">The growls would grow in volume and duration, then turn into bites, but still he’d go back for more. If one dog didn’t like his bum sniffed at, Dino would move on to the next, undeterred. Colette calls it sexual harassment.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-400">In the end, Dino was left with the loner hen (see The loner hen) for company. They’d go for walks together, exploring various parts of the farm, until the loner hen got eaten one day — by one of the hunting dogs.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-401">So Dino went back to bum-sniffing, which eventually erupted in a massive retaliation one day, as the other dogs sank their teeth into him and rolled him about in the mud. So that’s where he gets his matted fur from!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-402">Farm mistress Jeanette is a real sweetie with people, very good natured and easy-going, but you hear her constantly barking at Dino, many times a day. Without looking out of the window, I’ll know from Jeanette’s ticking off that he’s either been doing some sniffing, or stealing some dog’s food.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-403">He’s not perpetually hungry, though. One day I found him sitting down with a bun on the ground right in front of him. As soon as he saw me coming out of the house, he picked it up between his teeth and walked away from me. Fair enough, he thought I might want to take it from him. This happened every time I went anywhere near him. However, hours later, that bun was still uneaten. So he was just guarding it for the sake of stopping anyone from taking it from him. Strange dog.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-404">On my way back to London, as the plane was landing, I heard a hoarse raspy sound, a throaty sort of woof woof that was Dino’s bark. He had stowed away and was following me back! It turned out to be the speed brakes of the landing plane rasping.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-405">Caught a bus from where the airport bus dropped me near Olympia, and as it approached South Kensington Tube station, lo and behold, right ahead was a huge sign that I’d never noticed before, which said DINO’s [Italian restaurant]. No escape from the ball of scruff even back in London.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-406">Update (October 2011): Coming back on Monday 03 October from my visit to the farm this summer, I took the same bus via South Kensington as last year, and found that Dino’s has now become Muriel’s Kitchen. Wonder if it’s because they’d read my blog above and didn’t want to be associated with a ball of scruff...?</div>

<div class="para" id="p-408">On a(nother) visit to the French farm one year, I was greeted by a small black dog, barking furiously at me from the sofa where he had been dozing comfortably.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-409">I knew it didn’t belong to the farm because the farm dogs were:</div>

<div class="para" id="p-410">They said this dog was from Lasseran, the neighbouring village on the parallel ridge to the north. He was stressed out from his home environment as his owners had lots of boisterous children, so his owners brought him to the farm for some peace and quiet.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-411">A couple of days later, I noticed he was not around. They said he’d gone back, as he’d de-stressed enough from his stay on the farm.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-412">A day later, I saw him coming back, trotting across the fields.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-413">So, he’d come back to his spiritual retreat for another stay. And this time, he knew how to get to the farm himself.</div>

<div class="para" id="p-415">I arrived one summer at the French farm to find a new canine addition to the house. The dogs and cats on the farm were banned from the house.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-416">Farm mistress Jeanette would loudly shoo them out if she caught them, waving her arms wildly about and stamping her feet. She’s a kind soul, so I think she does it more to get a laugh out of seeing the frantic scrabbling about of claws on the floor tiles.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-417">This new dog was not only indoors, but actually sleeping on the living room floor, lying horizontally in the middle of the path from the front door of the living room through to the kitchen, so that one had to walk around it, or step over it, as it simply refused to budge. That is, if one didn’t trip over one of its outstretched legs or something and land right on top of it.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-418">What a strange spot to choose to be in a horizontal position: more effort involved in trying to get out of the way as he would have to get up fully — that is, if he was trying to get out of the way, which this dog obviously wasn’t bothered about.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-419">That encounter was in the afternoon.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-420">I mentioned this to Serge and Jeanette, and was told that the dog’s owner had brought it to the farm for them to look after as it had a leg injury. No wonder it got a leg injury, with such positioning sense, I thought.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-421">The following morning, I came across it at 8 am when I went to the loo at the back of the house, this time sleeping slap bang in the doorway between the kitchen and the loo/bathroom part of the house.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-422">This was even more stupid, as there was no room around it, and whoever going to the loo in the middle of the night could very well walk straight into it. I had to step carefully over it as, once again, it simply ignored me and stayed put.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-423">A bit later, on my way back from brushing my teeth in the bathroom (opposite the loo), I saw that the dog had now edged over to the upright bread bin sitting beside the doorway, with its head tilted, leaning against the side of the bread bin, eyes shut.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-424">The bread bin is really a 3ft-high narrow laundry basket, made of plastic with big holes, converted into a bread bin because it is the right length for French baguettes and its holes provide the ventilation for them.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-425">I thought it was unhygienic that the dog’s head should be right next to the baguettes, separated only by the holey plastic, so I moved the bin away. The dog’s head remained at that leaning angle in the air, for some 30 seconds before it lowered it to the floor in slow motion. It was like I was standing in frozen time.</div>

</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-437">The cats and dogs on the French farm are not allowed into the house at all, yet on one of my earlier visits some 15 years ago, I found this rule flouted by a black and white cat — either a young adult or an old kitten, I couldn’t tell, as it was small in size and young in appearance. I’ve never been good at telling the age of humans anyway, so it’s even harder with animals. I see the soul, not the shell.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-438">Soon, I could see why this cat was granted special dispensation: he had very winning ways. He wasn’t just good-looking (it’s so unfair, isn’t it?!?), he was also very obliging: lying on his side, he’d allow le patron Serge or Colette to twirl him round and round on the spot, without the slightest protest or indignation, happily basking in the attention. He was always handed bits of food from the dining table as he would beg most charmingly. Not grovel; just beg.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-439">Colette would coo to him whenever she saw him, “Minou, Minou, Minou!” so I assumed that was his name. Then one day, I heard Colette’s mother Jeanette call him “Mimi”.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-440">Mimi?!? I thought his name was Minou? And Mimi for a tom?? Ah well, it’s a foreign language to me, so maybe Mimi is all right as a name for a boy in French. Like Michel, which sounds just like Michelle to me. The French do things differently anyway.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-441">Some ten years later, on another visit of mine, we were invited round to the house of relatives of theirs, for a pre-Tour de France meal before going out to cheer them on as they whizzed through the village. This was a couple in their 60s, if not 70s. Imagine my surprise, then, when I heard the wife address the husband as “Minou”. I guess if Felix works as a name for both male cat and male human in English, why not Minou in French? When I commented on it, she explained that Minou sort of meant “darling”.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-442">Ah, the penny then dropped: Mimi is an abbreviation of Minou, reduplicated. From that minute on, I started calling him Monsieur Minou, which amused them heaps, but it has stuck since then, with everyone knowing him as Monsieur Minou. Lucky for him I didn’t choose to use the abbreviated version…</div>
<div class="para" id="p-443">I have since looked it up in the dictionary. Minou means pussycat, as well as “my sweetie”.</div>

Especially since the occupants of the house are all on what we call zero-hours contract in Britain, i.e., temporary work, which is usually menial, like bar-tending. I like climbing trees, too, as a tomboy, and haven’t had much opportunity for that in London.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-449">The black and white dog Kali came and stood under the tree to watch. My childhood chum Boo Bear the Alsatian used to eat any fruit (except banana), so I offered one to Kali, caught deftly and wolfed down in half a second. Thereafter, Kali got at least a 20% share of my pickings, never missing any of the figs thrown her way. She’s certainly not going to get goitre at this rate.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-450">Fig-picking done, I decided to play ball with Kali in the large garden, at first throwing, later kicking, and discovered she is a SUPER goalie.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-451">Even as you’re adjusting your foot — one tiny fraction of an inch to the left or right; or half circle; or full circle to face the opposite direction — she’ll immediately jerk her head and body in that direction, or run around to the other side, in anticipation of your being about to kick the (tennis) ball that way.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-452">No matter how many times you do this to try and wrong-foot her before you actually kick the ball, she responds instantly and tirelessly every single time, all the way until you actually kick it.

<div class="para" id="p-453">In the middle of my first night there, I decided at 3 am to go out and look at the night sky, as there’s no light pollution there. The sky over the French farm in Gers offers the most spectacular views of the Milky Way and lots of shooting stars.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-454">Emerging from my ground floor bedroom in the wing of the house, I found Kali sitting outside the door, with the ball on the floor in front of her, waiting for me to go and play ball! At 3 am!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-455">Kali is 11 or 12 years old. Google says, “Depending on the breed and size of the dog, 10 to 12 years is considered late middle age and the beginning of the elderly years.” Wow, a near-elderly goalkeeper, and so sharp as well at that age!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-456">It suddenly occurred to me as I was writing up the blog about her that Kali is a sheep dog. No wonder!

<div class="para" id="p-460">One of the things I noticed during an early stay on the French farm was: Jeanette didn’t look up at the sound of every approaching car.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-461">The farm is on a ridge parallel to, and north of, the Pyrénées, with a good view of the mountain range when the atmospheric pressure is right. They are hidden from view most of the time, so that you can’t even tell they are there. If they are fully visible in their snow-topped glory, then it’ll rain the next day (or so).</div>
<div class="para" id="p-462">The nearest neighbours are: Jean-Louis and Josianne 1km away down by the A21, the main road leading to the Pyrénées; and also 1km away in the other direction, the village idiot and his brother and sister-in-law further inland. Only the postman would drive up to the house. Or the neighbours, or friends and relatives, maybe the occasional first-time visitor — to buy wood from Serge’s little sawmill.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-463">For a farm that is out on a limb, they get quite a few visitors, so popular and hospitable are they. This means more cars being driven up to the house than its secluded location would otherwise attract.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-464">As is the case with almost everything on this farm, the dogs behave differently from the rest of the canine world beyond its boundaries, it seems: they only bark at outsiders. So, if one can hear a car pulling up and the dogs (and there were nine of them at one point) don’t bark, it is someone known to the family. How they manage to remember which car sound is a new one (to them), I shall never know.</div>

We went into town: to the market, to the little museum, then for a coffee. After that, we went back to her place for dinner and a chat, before she drove me back to the farm around 11 pm.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-471">Serge and Jeanette go to bed around 9 pm, so I asked her to drop me off at the bottom of the last stretch of the drive up, so that the dogs’ barking wouldn’t disturb the sleeping human occupants. I had a wind-up torch on me, but I didn’t need it as there was a full moon.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-472">It wasn’t until I reached the front door of the farm house that I realised the dogs had not barked at all throughout the 100-yard walk up the drive. It was dark, they only see me once a year, yet they somehow knew it was me — they presumably had a mental record of my footsteps (from the daytime), rather than the sound of a car engine. Amazing.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-473">I felt so honoured — to have been accepted by the dogs as family!</div>

France, 1990s)</div></section></section><div class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore" id="hk-fn-2"><div class="fn">Ironically, Google says: The term “pastou” (pronounced patou) is derived from the word “pastre”, meaning shepherd in old French and designates a shepherd’s dog as it was understood in times past. Unlike a herd dog, the role of the guard dog is not to drive the sheep but rather to protect them from wild animals or feral dogs.</div></div>
