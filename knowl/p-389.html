<div class="para">Talking of strange dogs: Dino has now actually overcome his risk-avoidance instincts and is competing with the little black cat (another new face) for stroking. The little black cat was practically head-butting my hand for stroking as I was positioning the 2 freeloaders (solar chargers for batteries and mobile phone) on the living/dining room window sill. He [Dino] has not yet learned, however, from the other dogs that one doesn’t bark at one’s own family car — Jeanette went out 5 minutes ago in the car, and Dino’s barking alerted me to the imminent arrival of a car, although I couldn’t hear the engine. It’s only 8.05 am, so I reckoned it must be Jeanette returning and stood up to watch from the front window as Dino continued to bark, the only one to do so. Sure enough, about 10 seconds later, Jeanette’s car appeared. Even when he had full view of it, Dino still carried on barking, all the way until she parked it in the garage/barn. I shall keep monitoring to see if there’s a pattern: maybe, being Dino and therefore does things totally differently, he’s barking to say hello, welcome back. Let’s see if he stays silent with visitors’ cars.</div>
