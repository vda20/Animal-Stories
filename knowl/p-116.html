<div class="para">As the youngest in the family, I was not allowed to remonstrate even if I’d been wrongly accused of something. That’s just the Chinese style of upbringing — in those days anyway, and certainly in my family. You do not argue, you just accept it, it comes with your status (or lack of). The grown-ups are always right, and even if they’re wrong, you do not point this out. (If you do, you now have the new crime of being argumentative and insolent, so you’re still in the wrong! If for a different reason this time.) Face, you know — you do not make the grown-ups lose face.</div>
