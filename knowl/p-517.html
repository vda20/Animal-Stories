<div class="para">I can’t remember who came up with the name (which sounds like merci in French), nor on what basis. Probably my eldest sister, who was the creative one when it came to party ideas and fun things. We had a dog named Boo Bear (after cartoon character Yogi Bear’s sidekick), another called Skopje (which we used to pronounce as skop-jay until years later when I discovered it is skop-yay, the place in [the former] Yugoslavia).</div>
