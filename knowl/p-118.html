<div class="para">Bear Bear would suddenly appear at my side, his face lighting up, “Ah, that’s where you are!! I’ve been looking all over the place for you.” Then, his face would go, “Oh, you’re crying,” and his whole body would sober up. He would sit down quietly beside me. I’d put my hand on his shoulder, and start to give him the details: who said what, how unfair they’d been to accuse me of this and that, not giving me a chance to answer back and clear my name. All this time, he’d wear a sombre look and his eyes would say, “Yes, yes, I understand, that’s so unfair, isn’t it? Poor you. I sympathise.” He’d lick my hand or face as further proof of his support.</div>
