<div class="para">Mummy Cat (as I call the variegated one with a series of successive broods, poor old girl) will try to get to your face for her to nuzzle, by climbing up your leg — or arm, if you bend down, say, to pull up some weeds — with her front legs. Sweet, but rather painful. She has this lovely touch of putting her paws on your shoulders, one on each side, then wrapping them round your neck in a big hug while she nuzzles your chin or cheek.</div>
