<div class="para">On the bare rooftop of the house (to the left) across the road was an upright grey shape next to the 2ft-high chimney pot, looking like a heron, taller than the chimney pot — just sitting very still. Not quite believing my eyes (why would a bird sit out there, unsheltered, in the wind and rain?), I watched it for a long time, waiting for some movement, to check that it was really a bird rather than something bird-like erected on the roof that I hadn’t noticed before. After a while, I gave up.</div>
