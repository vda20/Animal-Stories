<div class="para">Bear Bear did actually eventually learn, but his pride and reputation as a guard dog had to be preserved and maintained (which was why he did all that in the first place), so he came up with a compromise: he would charge up to the “intruder”, growling or barking, teeth bared, but stop short of actually making contact with the flesh. This meant he could do his duty of menacing the “intruder” without incurring a financial loss to his owner. Each time, I’d tell him how proud I was of him, “Well done! You see? No beating, no shouting at you. You can learn, and you do learn. Well done, Bear Bear. Clever boy.”</div>
