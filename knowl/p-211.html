<div class="para">Update on Wednesday 170811: Vláda says he’d gone to the trouble of getting hold of the contact number for the pigeon fanciers’ association, to whom he gave the pigeon’s ring tag number, and they tracked down the owner. Vláda then got in touch with the owner, who suggested Vláda drive the bird to a place nearer his house, then release it for it to fly home on its own. Maybe the bird got wind of this, which is why it suddenly disappeared from Hutĕ: the reason it ran away from home in the first place was it didn’t like it there, and now Vláda has actually traced its owner and is going to deliver it home (well, part of the way anyway).</div>
