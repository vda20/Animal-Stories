<div class="para">The pond section was covered over with a wooden frame: a slatted structure with wire netting, over which we placed about 20 pots of orchids to weigh it down. This hid the fact that there was a crocodile pond within those walls. (We lived by a main road.) It was also to prevent the crocs from escaping, and allow the water for the orchids to drip into the pond.</div>
