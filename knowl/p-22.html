<div class="para">Crocodiles wolf down their food whole but, having no tongue, they cannot move the food around in their mouth if the fish is facing the wrong way. If they pick up the fish with the tail facing the throat, they will not swallow it, as the jagged end is too jarring. If that happens, they will open their mouth, and toss the fish between the upper and lower jaws to rotate it â€” up and down, up and down, over and over again, until the head is facing the throat. Then they will swallow it.</div>
