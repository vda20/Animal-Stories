<div class="para">Heâ€™s not perpetually hungry, though. One day I found him sitting down with a bun on the ground right in front of him. As soon as he saw me coming out of the house, he picked it up between his teeth and walked away from me. Fair enough, he thought I might want to take it from him. This happened every time I went anywhere near him. However, hours later, that bun was still uneaten. So he was just guarding it for the sake of stopping anyone from taking it from him. Strange dog.</div>
