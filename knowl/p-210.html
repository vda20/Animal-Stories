<div class="para">Update on Monday 150811: This current pigeon was last seen on Friday morning, 120811, so we assume it’s plucked up courage and gone home. Perhaps it’s the food on offer here, i.e., not good enough. Perhaps it’s the constant presence of Tiapka the cat. (Tiapka means ‘paws’ in Czech, and she is so named because she has two-toed paws.) I have suggested to Vláda that he check out Tiapka’s tummy contents but he prefers to think the pigeon’s checked out of Hotel Hutĕ.</div>
