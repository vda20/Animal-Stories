<div class="para">The Indian man nervously trying to stop the dog from getting too close to him, instinctively holding out the loaf of bread in front of him as a shield. Many a time, weâ€™d end up with a half-bitten-off loaf delivered, or a loaf abandoned altogether, just sitting on the ground as the poor man made his escape. (As we lived by a main road, you can imagine the sight that greeted the drivers, passengers and pedestrians: a loaf of bread sitting by itself in the road, causing the vehicular and human traffic to wend its way around it until I went to pick it up off the tarmac.) After a few more times of this, the man would stand on the other side of the road and ring his bicycle bell, so I had to cross the road and collect the bread myself.</div>
