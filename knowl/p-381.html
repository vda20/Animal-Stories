<div class="para">As soon as he hears one of the other (six) dogs (stationed at the front of the house) bark, before he even gets a glimpse of what that dog might be barking at, he leaps straight into barking action, charging out to the front of the farm house, woofing with all his might but, as Jeanette mimes it to me, he has absolutely no clue what he’s barking about, glancing around him with a baffled look even while he’s barking furiously, wondering what he is supposed to be barking at or about. Often, he rushes up to Pastou (pronounced pa-tu), the old grandee of the dogs and his arch growling enemy, just barking at <em class="alert">him</em> instead. He seems to be joining in just for the sake of not wanting to be left out.</div>
