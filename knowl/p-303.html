<div class="para">Tuesday 270911: Tiger [came over to the sun lounger and] claimed my lap the moment I sat down although he was in the undergrowth by the downstairs bedroom (next to the kitchen), which is almost 10 ft away, so it’s definitely a conscious and deliberate effort/initiative on his part. He’s now grooming himself. Earlier I had the black/grey/white cat (the one that crosses its front paws). Tiger followed me, like the beige cat before, on my snail-collecting trip, and like the beige cat kept trying to nudge my hand as soon as I lowered it to pick up some snails. After some sharp-toned discouragement, aided by my hand pushing him away, the message got home and he sat to one side waiting. Fast learner, but also very forgiving for he’s still friends with me.</div>
