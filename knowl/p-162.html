<div class="para">In those days, we didn’t use vets for our animals. We just let them be: live the lives they were meant to live. Dogs were there to guard the house, cats were there to catch mice. They ate whatever leftover food we humans gave them — maybe a special treat now and then if we had more or surplus food (e.g., extra fish from the wholesale fishery market my father worked at). They slept on the covered patio floor, without a basket or a box — that was all right, in Singapore’s hot tropical climate. If they felt unwell, they just went out to the garden, ate some grass, coughed up the poison, and got well of their own accord. If they died, we buried them in the garden.</div>
