<div class="para">The housework in my family was meant to be roughly divided up into:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">the outdoor chores — to be done by the men (my father, brother, the old Malay tukang kebun [gardener]);</div></li>
<li><div class="para">the indoor chores — to be done by the women (my mother, two aunts, us four daughters, two female servants).</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">As a tomboy, I am useless at the girly tasks, so I undertook the men’s jobs: tending to the garden (including mowing thelawn), scrubbing out the drains, washing the car and the dog (plus one disastrous attempt at giving the cat a bath). Feeding the crocodiles and mucking out their pond thus became my duty, which I was happy to take on, because it was meditative.</div>
