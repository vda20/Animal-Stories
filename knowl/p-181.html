<div class="para">A couple of days later, I found Bear Bear lying on the floor next to his food bowl, a lump of food by his mouth. It looked like he’d choked on this lump of food, although he did manage to find the strength to cough it up. (Once again, in hindsight, we should’ve thought of cutting up his food into tiny pieces.) The effort of coughing up that lump of food must’ve been too much for him.</div>
