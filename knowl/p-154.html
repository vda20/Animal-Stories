<div class="para">This series of manoeuvres — him shuffling away (albeit by only a few inches), me moving up to him, him shuffling away, me moving up to him — would end up with him going round and round the pillar, shortening the chain until eventually he couldn’t go anywhere. Except in reverse — but then I was blocking his path back. So that was it. The poor chap had to sit out the rest of the plucking with no escape, not even by a few inches nor for a few more seconds. He never got angry or impatient with me, though, for inflicting this discomfort on him, such was his trust in me — he just went along with it because it was me (see later for more examples of this unconditional trust in me).</div>
