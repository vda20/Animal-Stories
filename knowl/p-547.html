<div class="para">There were oak trees around the farm, so it became a daily routine for me to go and pick them, every few hours. Just like my twice-daily trips to a field to pick alfalfa for the rabbits. These little chores, in addition to bringing in the logs for the two stoves, harvesting or planting the broad beans, etc., gave me a purpose to my days, as well as providing a complete change from my London life as a teacher and translator, sitting at the computer most of the time. Iâ€™ve found my own spiritual retreat while helping to take some of the workload off their shoulders.</div>
