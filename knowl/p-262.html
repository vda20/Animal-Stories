<div class="para">I was visiting David and Jane one day, standing at their front door after having rung the bell, when I suddenly looked up and spotted Jiang sitting on the external sill of the first floor window, looking to the distance like he was day-dreaming. I called out to him, “Jiang!” He turned round, immediately answered back, and actually started to walk along the eaves over the ground floor (which is rather precarious) to come over to me. He did reach me, jumping down from the first floor.</div>
