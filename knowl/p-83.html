<div class="para">Kitty Kat, presumably having first checked that my aunt was not in sight, would come and sit on the floor by the sofa, look up at me and miaow sweetly, in a begging tone of voice, “Can I come up and sit by you, please?” I’d then shift towards the back of the sofa, pat the space and say, “上來 shànglái / come up!” Kitty would then jump up and snuggle up against me, purring blissfully. He always waited for me to say 上來; he was never presumptuous. (Someone in the family — don’t know who — had started the tradition of speaking to the dog in English and Mandarin Chinese to the cat. Boo Tat, an RI [Raffles Institution] classmate of mine, suggested: “Divide and rule!”)</div>
