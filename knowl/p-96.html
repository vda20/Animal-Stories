<div class="para">Around the relaxed couple were three little kittens, jumping up and down on daddy’s and mummy’s tummy, pouncing on their tails and biting the tips, chewing the tips of their ears or paws. They couldn’t have been more than a few months old. So that was why Kitty brought her home! To give birth in our roof. I felt most honoured indeed that he’d chosen to bring her to our place for the birth. We obviously could be trusted to treat her well.</div>
