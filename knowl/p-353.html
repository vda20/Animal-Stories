<div class="para">My eggsperiment produced results within a day, much sooner than I’d expected. Jeanette reported egg production up by 50%. The 20 hens and turkeys would normally produce about eight eggs a day in the summer (daughter Isabelle said “down to a minimum in August/September”), but after my twice-daily supply of escargots, we’d get 12 per day. In the end, we were giving the eggs away to people to thank them for their help: ploughing the fields and harvesting the crops when Jeanette was down with cancer a few years back.</div>
