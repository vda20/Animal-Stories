<div class="para">Practically all the cats are highly responsive and interactive, although in different ways. Each looks different (in colour combinations and patterns) and each has his/her own very individualistic mannerisms and way of communicating with you. As I got to know each one, I found myself saying to them in turn every day — often more than once a day: “I wish I could take you back to London with me.” I can see why Serge and Jeanette have them around, even though it means extra work and cost, because they fill one’s life with so much affection.</div>
