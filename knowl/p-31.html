<div class="para">I went a step further in recycling water. I used the water that had defrosted the sprats to soak the pots of orchids. This process was most time-consuming: leave each pot sitting in the fish water for about five minutes (you can see bubbles rising to the surface as the brick and charcoal chips absorb the water), then remove and leave on the lawn, so that the lawn grass benefits from the run-off water. Win, win and win.</div>
