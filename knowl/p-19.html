<div class="para">The crocodile nursery was made of three concrete rings, with a diameter of six feet, each about a foot tall, piled up to make a high-enough enclosure so that the baby crocs could not escape. The bottom was filled with about three inches of water, for them to immerse themselves in for cooling off from the tropical heat. We also left small boulders and bricks dotted about for them to perch on, should they get fed up of being in the water.</div>
