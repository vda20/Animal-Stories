<div class="para">At the end of each day, an hour before sundown, farm mistress Jeanette would open the gate to the chicken and turkey enclosure, and let them wander around in the neighbouring ex-kitchen garden (moved to the rear, far side of the house). This is to give them a change of environment and activity, scrabbling for worms and the seeds of the amaranth (莧菜 xiàncài) which grows all over the countryside, treated by the French as a weed, but a common veg in the Chinese diet.
