<div class="para">One day, she asked me to look after her goldfish, as she was going away on holiday in Spain for a fortnight. She said I had to feed it twice a day â€” once in the morning and once in the evening, and also change its water at least once a week. When changing its water, I was to take the fish out and put it in a cup of clean water, clean out the bowl and change the water, then put the fish back.</div>
