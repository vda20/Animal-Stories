<div class="para">As an evening teacher, with post-lesson pubbing sessions with my mature students after classes at nine o’clock, I would only arrive at David and Jane’s house around 11.30 pm. Feeling that I couldn’t just go straight to bed, I’d switch on the TV, sit on the floor, leaning back at a 60-degree angle against the front of the sofa, almost in a horizontal position. Jiang would come and sit on my chest, stretching out his long body over my front, his hind legs down my upper legs to just above my knees, and his head below my chin, paws wrapped around my neck. He’d then go to sleep happily in this position, leaving me unable to move until my legs went numb and I had to shift, or I had to go to bed.</div>
