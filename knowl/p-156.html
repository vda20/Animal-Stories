<div class="para">I showed him the plucked-out offenders, gripped between the ends of the tweezers, “You see these things? These nasty things are biting into your flesh. They are sucking out your blood. They are living off you. Your itching and scratching is all due to them. I know the plucking is a bit unpleasant, but it’s all for your good, so if you’ll just put up with it, you’ll feel better once I’ve got rid of them for you. You’ll be itch-free and scratch-free once I’m done. Be patient and bear with me. I’m doing this for your good.”</div>
