<div class="para">The Chinese soya sauce and sesame oil man — in a Chinese-style cotton garment (Chinese collar, Chinese cloth buttons) and a large pointed-top palm-leaf hat (the type one sees on rice field workers, especially in Vietnam) — instinctively using his conical hat to try and block the progression of the dog’s teeth, and getting a chunk of the tip bitten off. (Might’ve been his fingers…) After a few repeats, that man never stopped outside our house again. He’d actually pedal faster as he approached our gate, so we had to run down the road after him if we spotted him. Or, if he had managed to sneak past our house altogether, go and get our soya sauce and sesame oil from the shop.</div>
