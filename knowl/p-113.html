<div class="para">There was one odd thing about him, though: he didn’t like banana, yet he’d sit there and go through the whole process when I was eating a banana. I had to tell him eventually, after he’d done all the lip-licking and swallowing hard and loud, “This is banana. You don’t like banana,” break off a piece and hold it right up to his nose for him to smell it. His face was always a sight to behold: he’d look disgusted and crinkle his nose, “Uggh, is that what it is?!? I’ve been wasting my time,” then go away and leave me alone for the rest of my banana. It was odd that he couldn’t smell it until it was right up against his nose.</div>
