<div class="para">Other attacks were a bit more serious: often a young child, aged four or five, thus about the right height for a dog to bite in the face; an old person, often too doddery to run away or thrust some form of barrier in the path of the suddenly advancing dog. These were the ones who were actually bitten, which meant our not only apologising profusely (as we had to do with those delivery men) but also giving them money to go for a tetanus jab, just in case. Nowadays (or in some litigious country), weâ€™d have been sued many times over.</div>
