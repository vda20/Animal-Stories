<div class="para">Note: Hutĕ is a hamlet of eight households — six cottages in a terrace and, on the other side of the patch of bare land (which I romantically call “village green”), a big house partitioned into two. The inhabitants used to be the manager and workers of the local glass factory. For those who don’t already know, the Czech Republic (previously Czechoslovakia) is famous for its glassware. My hosts, teachers Vláda and Jana, say they still occasionally unearth shards in their kitchen garden and the surrounding fields (owned by the local government, planting various crops for feeding livestock).</div>
