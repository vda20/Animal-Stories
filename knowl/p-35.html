<div class="para">My father’s (not-always-well-thought-out) design had come up with a well (about 1’6” in diameter) the other side of the hole, for the water to flow into, instead of a duct in the ground to lead the dirty water directly to the open drain at the edge of the garden. This lack of foresight meant having to empty the well, bucket by bucket. I have heard or read this saying somewhere that would apply to this situation: “Kitchens are used by women but designed by men.” I treated it all as good exercise, however, and the water scooped out from that well also went to the flowers in the garden, instead of straight down the drain. Further recycling.</div>
