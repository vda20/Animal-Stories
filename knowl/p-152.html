<div class="para">They tended to team up — parasite in every sense: not just parasitising on the host (the dog in this case) but parasitising on each other as well (one opening up the hole in the skin, the other jumping on the bandwagon and exploiting this initial effort). A fattened, full-up louse, all grey and waxy — the size of a ladybird, and actually looking like a ladybird in shape as well, but plump and soft, unlike a ladybird’s (seemingly) hard outer covering. Next to it, a scrawny and much smaller flea, browny-red and spider-like with its legs. By cosying up to each other, they saved me work, as I could pluck them out as a pair and drop them into the paraffin. Two bloodsuckers with one tweezer move.</div>
