<div class="para">Some ten years later, on another visit of mine, we were invited round to the house of relatives of theirs, for a pre-Tour de France meal before going out to cheer them on as they whizzed through the village. This was a couple in their 60s, if not 70s. Imagine my surprise, then, when I heard the wife address the husband as “Minou”. I guess if Felix works as a name for both male cat and male human in English, why not Minou in French? When I commented on it, she explained that Minou sort of meant “darling”.</div>
