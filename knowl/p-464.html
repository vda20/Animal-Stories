<div class="para">As is the case with almost everything on this farm, the dogs behave differently from the rest of the canine world beyond its boundaries, it seems: they only bark at outsiders. So, if one can hear a car pulling up and the dogs (and there were nine of them at one point) donâ€™t bark, it is someone known to the family. How they manage to remember which car sound is a new one (to them), I shall never know.</div>
