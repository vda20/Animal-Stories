<div class="para">(The main diet of the dogs and cats on the farm were fed mainly stale baguette — from the bakery in the nearest village, in exchange for various produce from the farm: eggs, for example. It’d be soaked in water and lard, so anything outside of that is a treat, even kitchen scraps which are rejects from humans. I can’t help being reminded of the human situation with some countries being so picky about their food and others not even getting the bare minimum…. Or some humans in the same country even.)</div>
