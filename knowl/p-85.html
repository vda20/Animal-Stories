<div class="para">For some reason, Kitty didn’t spot my aunt in the crowd. He came up to my sofa, sat on the floor and begged in his usual persuasive manner to be allowed up on the sofa with me. Conscious of my aunt’s presence, I had to harden my heart and said to Kitty, “不行，姨媽說你不能上來 bù xíng, Yímā shuō nǐ bù néng shànglái / No, Auntie says you can’t come up!” All Kitty heard was the last two sounds “上來 shànglái / come up”, so he leapt up straightaway.
