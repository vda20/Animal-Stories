<div class="para">Singapore used to import a high proportion of its water from Malaysia — still does, but a smaller amount now (we used to have three reservoirs, now 15) — with every drop metered. To collect rainwater, my father had built a water butt out of concrete rings, with a diameter of six feet and each about a foot in height, piled up to seven or eight rings high to reach the gutter. (The same concrete rings he’d used to build the crocodile nursery, using just three rings.) This water would be used for the plants, and for cleaning the car, the drains, the floor — and the dog (plus the cat on the one disastrous occasion — see also <em class="emphasis">Giving the cat a bath</em>).</div>
