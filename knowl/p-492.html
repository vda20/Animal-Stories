<div class="para">Worse, around my neck, I had a Pentax camera with a metal lens cap, unfortunately not attached to the camera by a cord — like how skis are to the ankles, in case one falls over and the skis unclip, so that they don’t go careering down the slopes. One of those pine tree branches also whipped my lens cap off, so I lost that for good, as I couldn’t go back for it, unaided (to get me off, then back on, the horse) — besides, the others were on the path, a distance away.</div>
