<div class="para">(I was judging that heron with my own human standards: why sit out there in the wind and rain? Reminds me of once, after work in Taipei, when colleague Peggy walked me to the street a few blocks away from the Conoco office to catch my bus home. It was drizzling. I said I’d like to walk on for a bit. Peggy immediately became concerned, “Would you like to talk about it?” To the Chinese, if someone wants to walk in the rain, it must be because they have something on their mind.)</div>
