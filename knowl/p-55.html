<div class="para">One afternoon, I came across a grown-up crocodile lying in the gutter on the edge of our garden some five or six yards from the crocodile enclosure. The drain was the width of its belly (about five inches across), so it fitted snugly. Don’t know how it got there, nor how long it’d been sitting there. Perhaps the heavy rain the night before had raised the water level of the pond in the enclosure, and somehow it managed to escape without upsetting the frame enough to make it obvious.</div>
