<div class="para">This time, he was a lot more trusting of me, actually allowing me to go all the way up to him, and to pat and stroke his head. Quite an improvement, indeed, from when I first met him in the summer of 2010. (Update: summer 2012: he was actually following me around practically everywhere, which he used to do with Jeanette.) (Further update: Dino was actually competing with the little black cat when the latter came up to me for stroking!)</div>
