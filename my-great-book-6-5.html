<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-2">Next door neighbour, who’d only moved in a couple of years previously, when I was 10 or so, heard about our crocodiles and decided to copy us.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-3">He was a police inspector, with a chauffeur, so he didn’t need the extra income surely? Just trying to outdo us, I bet. (There’s a term in Singlish [Singapore English], called KS, short for “kia su” in Hokkien (福建 Fújiàn), one of the southern Chinese dialects in Singapore — meaning “afraid to lose”, i.e., competitive.)</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-4">In my dialect, another southern Chinese dialect called Teochew (潮州 Cháozhōu), “police inspector” is called “dwǎ gào / Big Dog”.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-5">So, Big Dog started building his own crocodile enclosure at the bottom of the garden, against the back garden wall. Instead of feeding them dead fish like we did, he gave them newly hatched live chicks — apparently, this makes them grow faster.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-6">Every other day, a van would arrive. We’d hear the van run along their driveway, which was parallel to our common garden wall.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-7">The garden partition used to be a hedge when we first moved in, in 1958. It was made up of mainly the common hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), called 大紅花 dà hóng huā / “big red flower” in Chinese.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-8">We children would go and have endless fun at that hedge, catching spiders and big red ants, keeping them in matchboxes. With the red ants, we’d pull off their antennae, put them together in a bigger box, and watch them fight — without their feelers, ants can’t identify their own kind. Children can be terrible like that, getting pleasure out of such cruel pursuits.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-9">As soon as he moved in, Big Dog tore down the hibiscus hedge and put up a forbidding brick wall, about 6 ft high. Like as if we’d spy on him and his family.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-10">For some reason, Big Dog went for a brick wall with gaps in it rather than a solid one — the bricks were staggered at each level, giving a chequerboard effect. He should be rich enough not to have to worry about paying for a few more bricks, surely [meow]. He was obviously even more unsociable than the previous occupants — the eccentric mother-and-son team, building a wall that made sure we couldn’t look into their garden and house. Like as if we had nothing better to do.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-11">The van comes to a halt. You can hear the driver getting out. Opens the back doors. A wave of “chirp chirp chirp chirp cheep cheep cheep cheep” emanates from the other side of the garden wall.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-12">The man pulls out one tray of chicks. Walks from the back of the van to the crocodile enclosure. Tips the tray over the side of the enclosure wall. He goes back for another tray. The whole process is repeated until all the chicks have been dispatched. Man shuts the rear doors of his van. Drives off.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-13">The “chirp chirp chirp chirp cheep cheep cheep cheep” becomes “chirp chirp chirp cheep cheep cheep”. Then “chirp chirp cheep cheep”. Then “chirp cheep”. Then silence.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-14">Lucky, then, for one chick that Big Dog didn’t construct a solid brick wall. It was through one of those gaps in the wall that one day, one of the chicks intended for Big Dog’s crocodiles fled over to our side. It must’ve jumped ship as the delivery van man pulled out the tray or was carrying it to the croc enclosure.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-15">We decided not to give it back to him.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-16">Once the chick was old enough to live in the open, it was given the soursop tree to perch on. (Soursop: Annona muricata, also called graviola, guyabano and, in Hispanic America, guanábana. We call it “Western durian” in my dialect, maybe because of its spikes.)</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-17">When it was big enough, we decided to spare it from the cooking pot, for it’d become more like a pet really, although there wasn’t much interaction between us. (We didn’t interact much either with the crocodiles, or the tortoise, or the canaries, or the crow, or the guinea pig, or the tropical fish, or the monkey.)</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-18">We later came to regret this act of mercy, however, for the chick turned out to be a rooster.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-19">The soursop tree was outside my bedroom, at the end of the annex block that my mother added to house us five children, when I was about nine. It was bad enough for it to be crowing early in the morning when you wanted just an extra few minutes of sleep, but in its old age, it’d crow at the oddest of hours, getting earlier and earlier: from 5 am to 4 am, then 3 am, then even 2 am, or anytime it felt like it.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-20">I used to shout at him from my bed, “Should’ve eaten you ages ago!”</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-21">It eventually died of old age.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-2-22">Now, at my own ripe old age and not always with it, I feel bad about having shouted at him. I wonder if he’d taken all those threats of mine to heart and decided to die before he found himself on our dinner table. Oops, did he die of a heart attack, worrying about being dinner…? Oh dear.</div>

<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-4">(France, September/October 2011)</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-5">
<em class="alert">Update 280112</em>: It’s been a long incubation, getting this blog hatched.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-6">I’d been cutting greens (found out much later they were alfalfa) for the rabbits, whose hutches are within the same enclosure as the hens.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-7">I would immediately, while still in the field, conscientiously pick off the minute escargots that clung to the stems and leaves. On one occasion, just as I was about to feed the greens to the rabbits, I noticed that I’d missed out on a couple of escargots, so I picked them off and threw them onto the ground, which were instantly pounced upon by the hens.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-8">It set me thinking that the hens might welcome the change in their usual diet of grain and vegetable scraps from the kitchen, and the escargot shell would provide the calcium for eggshell-making.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-9">Previous offerings of normal size escargots were left untouched. I think it’s because they were too big for the hens to handle: shell too hard to break into, flesh too big and tough to pick at.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-10">Besides, even if I couldn’t make much of a dent in the escargot population, it might help save some of the wooden boundary posts. The chap in the village was complaining only the other day that they chomp through his fence posts at an alarming rate. He came back from a few days away to find his flower population decimated.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-11">The next foray into the field saw me equipped with not just the bucket and knife for the greens, but also a big plastic yoghurt tub and teaspoon for the escargots. The teaspoon is for scooping up any escargot dropped, as it’s difficult to pick up the tiny pests with one’s fingers.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-12">I soon discovered that another field was so densely populated with the creatures that, instead of picking them singly off each stalk of alfalfa or blade of grass, I could just pick up a dried thistle branch and shake off all the clingers-on into the plastic tub, or scrape huge clusters off the boundary posts, thus filling up the yoghurt tub within five minutes max and saving myself a lot of work.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-13">I’d then approach the hen enclosure, rattling the tub to build up their eagerness in anticipation as part of the training (see also Pig training). Sure enough, the hens would pounce on the little tit-bits tossed over the fence, especially the turkeys who absolutely relished them.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-14">My eggsperiment produced results within a day, much sooner than I’d expected. Jeanette reported egg production up by 50%. The 20 hens and turkeys would normally produce about eight eggs a day in the summer (daughter Isabelle said “down to a minimum in August/September”), but after my twice-daily supply of escargots, we’d get 12 per day. In the end, we were giving the eggs away to people to thank them for their help: ploughing the fields and harvesting the crops when Jeanette was down with cancer a few years back.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-15">Daughter Isabelle said snail diet was common during her grandparents’ time.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-16">I will be repeating the eggsperiment this coming summer, just to make sure it wasn’t a coincidence, and report back. Watch this space!</div>

<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-3-18">Update September 2012: They’ve got wise! They’ve sussed out my ulterior motive in feeding them these little escargots, so they’ve begun shunning my efforts. Well, that’s the end to my mega egg-producing business dreams then.</div></section><section class="subsection" id="my-great-book-6-5-4"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-2">(This first appeared as a blog.)</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-3">There is a motley collection of animals on the farm: cows, turkeys and chickens, rabbits, dogs and cats. (They used to have geese and ducks, too, but got rid of them after the mother had cancer.)</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-4">The cows are left out in the fields to graze, and would only come in if it is very cold in the winter, or be brought in the night before their vaccinations.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-5">The dogs and cats are free to wander around outside, although most of their time in the summer is spent in a horizontal position in the shade (temperatures can get to 42˚C). Hard life being a dog or a cat, isn’t it.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-6">The turkeys and chickens are kept in a corralled area at the back, in the same pen housing the rabbit hutches.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-7">On one particular visit, I saw a lone hen running around the front of the farm house.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-8">At the end of each day, an hour before sundown, farm mistress Jeanette would open the gate to the chicken and turkey enclosure, and let them wander around in the neighbouring ex-kitchen garden (moved to the rear, far side of the house). This is to give them a change of environment and activity, scrabbling for worms and the seeds of the amaranth (莧菜 xiàncài) which grows all over the countryside, treated by the French as a weed, but a common veg in the Chinese diet. So, I thought that the lone hen had broken loose from this area.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-9">When I saw it a third time at the front of the house, I mentioned it to Jeanette, wondering if we should perhaps go and catch it.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-10">It turned out that she (the hen, not Jeanette) hated being cooped up like the rest of her fowl folk, and kept breaking out. After the nth time of catching her and returning her to the corral, Jeanette decided to let her be. The hen never gave her any more trouble.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-11">Jeanette’s husband Serge had left some bales of hay in the barn/garage area for temporary storage. The hen took to laying an egg on top of one of the bales. After Serge removed the bales, she carried on laying her eggs there, straight onto the concrete floor, in the exact same spot where she’d been laying them thus far on the top of the bale. Habits do die hard even with hens, it seems.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-12">The hen started to team up with Dino, adopted latecomer to the farm (see also Dino the dirty dog), staying close to him. They went everywhere together.</div>
<div class="para" id="my-great-book-6-5-4-13">The sight of Dino the scruffy long-haired long-legged mottled black-grey dog (as against the short-haired short-legged brown hunting dogs on the farm) walking around the farm, followed everywhere by the one hen, was rather endearing and heart-warming — two socially awkward creatures who didn’t fit in with their own kind managing to build up an unlikely companionable relationship with each other.</div>
