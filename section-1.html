</h2>
<div class="para" id="p-10">I came home from school one day, aged nine, to find that the baby crocodiles had arrived.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-11">Father had been busy the past few weeks in the front garden, building some kind of structure designed by himself.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-12">He was perpetually doing that, gripped by a sudden burst of inspiration and energy: “This will make a lot of money. Just you wait!”</div>
<div class="para" id="p-13">He’d sit down and draw up plans and designs, then go out and return with the material, often making a number of trips. You’d then find one corner of the garden taken over, with all the bits spread around, messing the place up for weeks and weeks, if not months, which would invariably set my mother off.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-14">At the dinner table, he’d make a fuss about how much weight he’d lost, holding out his waistband to prove his point.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-15">Nobody took much notice of him, as these eccentric projects of his didn’t usually come to much, if anything at all.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-16">So! The structure he’d been working on the last few weeks turned out to be a home for crocodiles!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-17">That was the permanent one for the adults. Permanent until they left us, that is.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-18">There was another one for the babies, only for until they were transferred to the grown-up enclosure.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-19">The crocodile nursery was made of three concrete rings, with a diameter of six feet, each about a foot tall, piled up to make a high-enough enclosure so that the baby crocs could not escape. The bottom was filled with about three inches of water, for them to immerse themselves in for cooling off from the tropical heat. We also left small boulders and bricks dotted about for them to perch on, should they get fed up of being in the water.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-20">The babies were about two feet long: 10 inches for the body, 5 inches for the snout, and 9 inches for the tail. They grew to about 5 feet long, or more.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-21">To feed them, we used the fine, flexible end of the main vein of coconut leaves to thread through the sprat, then, holding the thick end, lowered it and dangled it near their mouth. Quick as a flash, they’d snatch it, sometimes so roughly that they’d end up snapping off the thin skewer, still stuck in the fish.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-22">Crocodiles wolf down their food whole but, having no tongue, they cannot move the food around in their mouth if the fish is facing the wrong way. If they pick up the fish with the tail facing the throat, they will not swallow it, as the jagged end is too jarring. If that happens, they will open their mouth, and toss the fish between the upper and lower jaws to rotate it — up and down, up and down, over and over again, until the head is facing the throat. Then they will swallow it.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-23">It takes a bit of practice not to toss the fish too vigorously, as it might fall out, which they learn ultimately to get right. That, or go hungry.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-24">If the fish falls out during the tossing, they’ll have to start all over again, turning their head sideways to grasp it between their jaws. They might then fail to re-grab the fish, or drop it yet again after re-grabbing, which will take them back to Step 1 of the chain of feeding, so they could be there all day, just trying to eat one little sprat (4”–5” long), poor things.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-25">The enclosure for the adults was a 15’x5’ concrete oblong, surrounded by brick walls about 3’ high. It looks like one of those contraptions placed over a bath, for holding the soap, shampoo and back scrubber — called a bath (caddy) rack: dipping in the middle (for the wet-pond section), rising up gently to level areas at each end (for the dry-land sections).</div>
<div class="para" id="p-26">A tap was installed on the inside of one wall, for refilling the pond. In the middle of one of the long-sided pond walls, at the base, was a hole, for draining off the dirty water when we cleaned out the pond, then bunged (on the outside!) for filling up the pond with clean water.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-27">The pond section was covered over with a wooden frame: a slatted structure with wire netting, over which we placed about 20 pots of orchids to weigh it down. This hid the fact that there was a crocodile pond within those walls. (We lived by a main road.) It was also to prevent the crocs from escaping, and allow the water for the orchids to drip into the pond.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-28">Orchids have aerial roots, so they are planted not in soil but in brick and charcoal chips in a pot with holes all round. This means that when you water the orchids, the water runs off immediately.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-29">Singapore imports its water from Malaysia — used to be a higher percentage during my childhood days, when we had only three reservoirs (now 15). We all have water meters, so we pay for every single drop of water used.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-30">My family was very big on recycling, especially when it came to water. We’d have a bucket permanently stationed by the kitchen sink. Any used water that was non-greasy, e.g., from washing vegetables or rinsing dishes, would go into the bucket, then carried out to the garden for the plants.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-31">I went a step further in recycling water. I used the water that had defrosted the sprats to soak the pots of orchids. This process was most time-consuming: leave each pot sitting in the fish water for about five minutes (you can see bubbles rising to the surface as the brick and charcoal chips absorb the water), then remove and leave on the lawn, so that the lawn grass benefits from the run-off water. Win, win and win.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-32">The dry-land ends of the crocodile enclosure were hidden under concrete stepped terraces above, upon which we placed more pots of orchids. (We had about 50 pots of orchids in our garden.) The whole thing looked like just an innocent tiered arrangement of potted orchids.</div>
<div class="para logical" id="p-33">
<div class="para">The housework in my family was meant to be roughly divided up into:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-1"><div class="para" id="p-derived-li-1">the outdoor chores — to be done by the men (my father, brother, the old Malay tukang kebun [gardener]);</div></li>
<li id="li-2"><div class="para" id="p-derived-li-2">the indoor chores — to be done by the women (my mother, two aunts, us four daughters, two female servants).</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">As a tomboy, I am useless at the girly tasks, so I undertook the men’s jobs: tending to the garden (including mowing thelawn), scrubbing out the drains, washing the car and the dog (plus one disastrous attempt at giving the cat a bath). Feeding the crocodiles and mucking out their pond thus became my duty, which I was happy to take on, because it was meditative.</div>
</div>
<div class="para" id="p-34">To clean out the crocodile enclosure, I’d remove the bung (on the outside!) and let the pond water run off. It often took half an hour.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-35">My father’s (not-always-well-thought-out) design had come up with a well (about 1’6” in diameter) the other side of the hole, for the water to flow into, instead of a duct in the ground to lead the dirty water directly to the open drain at the edge of the garden. This lack of foresight meant having to empty the well, bucket by bucket. I have heard or read this saying somewhere that would apply to this situation: “Kitchens are used by women but designed by men.” I treated it all as good exercise, however, and the water scooped out from that well also went to the flowers in the garden, instead of straight down the drain. Further recycling.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-36">When the pond was drained, I’d lean over the side of the enclosure wall, use a long-handled broom to chase the crocs off the dry-land sections down into the emptied pond in the middle, scrub the floor of the dry-land areas, and hose down. Then, I’d use the broom to chase the crocodiles back on to the dry-land sections, so that I could scrub and rinse out the pond. Once this was done, I’d put the bung back in (on the outside!), and turn on the tap inside, to fill the pond.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-37">You might think this was all very boring work. Not a bit. I got loads of fun out of this seemingly monotonous, tedious and mundane physical-labour chore.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-38">On one occasion, while I was scrubbing out the floor of the pond, one of the crocodiles suddenly got curious about what was going on, and decided to leave the dry-land section and venture down to find out, walking straight under the bristles that were going back and forth. Instinctively, I immediately apologised, “Oh, sorry, sorry!” as the bristles were quite thick.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-39">The crocodile, however, absolutely loved it, half shutting its eyes in rapturous enjoyment. Oh, I see! Its hide is so thick that the tough bristles of the broom actually tickled it, rather than hurt it! I ran the bristles over the crocodile one more time. Yes! It’s lowering its eyelids again!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-40">So, I went through this motion again and again, giving it a back scratch. Before long, another crocodile twigged, and started leaving the dry-land area to get its back tickled as well.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-41">Soon, I was busy scrubbing the backs of some five or six crocodiles, all thoroughly enjoying their back scrub, sitting very still, rolling their eyes into their foreheads.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-42">The area most sensitive is between the lower legs, where our human coccyx would be, at the base of the spinal column. If you scratch that part of the croc, it will, along with lowering its eyelids, raise that part of its body, standing on its hind feet, arching its lower back.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-43">On another occasion, as the tap was running, filling the scrubbed-out pond with fresh water, one crocodile discovered this source of tumbling cold water, and went to sit directly underneath, letting the water splash onto its neck. Sheer bliss! Having cold water splashing on one’s neck in the tropical heat! It closed its eyelids in absolute ecstasy. (I could almost see a smile on its face.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-44">Soon, another crocodile cottoned on to what this first chap was doing, and came over to muscle in on the deliciously cold shower, sitting on top of the first one. Before long, a third crocodile also got the picture, and climbed on top of the second croc. Then, a fourth one on top of the third. The croc pile got too high, and the whole stack toppled.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-45">My father took the occasional turn at feeding, and/or cleaning out the pond.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-46">His brain was filled with strange ideas, my father. He thought he would train the crocodiles to get used to him — the master. So, during feeding time, he’d whistle a particular tune (made up by himself) as he threw the sprats in. This went on for months on end.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-47">Father was really pleased with himself, “See? They recognise the tune, they know it’s me! They come running when they hear the tune!” I decided not to enlighten him: they’re hungry, it’s feeding time, you’re throwing down the fish as you’re whistling the tune.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-48">One day, my father decided to clean out the pond. Instead of standing on the lawn side of the enclosure wall, safely leaning over the wall to scrub out the floor of the pond, he decided to jump in. After all, the crocs had all been chased up onto the dry-land areas, so they were safely out of the way. Weren’t they?</div>
<div class="para" id="p-49">He then made the mistake of whistling the feeding-time tune as he scrubbed away merrily. My father had obviously never heard about Pavlov’s dog. One of the crocodiles, associating it with food, came down from the dry land, and sank its teeth into my father’s ankle.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-50">With a sharp yelp, my father leapt out of the pond in one swift move. He started beating the crocodile with the broom: “You stupid animal!! Don’t you know I’m your master!?! You don’t go biting your own master!!” (Yes, he had to go to the hospital for a few stitches.)</div>
<div class="para" id="p-51">Another day, Father came home with a tortoise. It was decided that Tick Tock should go in the crocodile enclosure. Maybe for the company. It had a hard shell to hide under, after all. It should be all right.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-52">My eldest sister named it Tick Tock, maybe because they are slow, maybe because of Tick Tock the Crocodile in Peter Pan.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-53">Tick Tock survived for a few years alongside the crocodiles, until one night when he probably got too curious during a crocodile fight and stuck out his head to look. The next day I found his head sitting a few inches away from his shell.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-54">It was ironical that my sister named it Tick Tock, even though our Tick Tock didn’t actually end up in the crocodile’s belly. Maybe the crocs felt guilty — maybe they had an Oops! moment when they discovered that their fighting had ended up in Tick Tock’s decapitation, and that’s why they didn’t eat his head. Perhaps crocs have a conscience too.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-55">One afternoon, I came across a grown-up crocodile lying in the gutter on the edge of our garden some five or six yards from the crocodile enclosure. The drain was the width of its belly (about five inches across), so it fitted snugly. Don’t know how it got there, nor how long it’d been sitting there. Perhaps the heavy rain the night before had raised the water level of the pond in the enclosure, and somehow it managed to escape without upsetting the frame enough to make it obvious.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-56">I raised the alarm, and a few helpers were scrambled. We got a sack to throw over its head, and quickly clamped its jaws together. We then lifted it out of the drain, and put it back into the enclosure.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-57">It had created a bit of a panic at the time, because that smaller open drain in our garden led to a bigger open drain by the main road outside our garden. If the crocodile had not been spotted in time, it might’ve found its way to that bigger drain, and thence to a monsoon storm drain (easily the width of two cars at least for the smaller ones), which would make it impossible to capture, thus posing a danger to the public.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-58">When the crocs were big enough to be sold, my father would persuade his fishery firm colleagues to come round and catch them. Only the skin was sold for turning into expensive handbags and wallets, belts and shoes, so my father would give the meat to the croc catchers.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-59">In the Chinese culture, one doesn’t really pay friends with money for their help. Crocodile meat was not available on the open market, and the Chinese love unusual kinds of food, so it worked perfectly for all parties.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-60">The way our crocodiles were caught was to have two men to do the direct trapping, each armed with a stick and a lasso attached to one end.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-61">They stand at the enclosure wall, and lower the lassoes. Slowly, slowly, one lasso approaches the jaw end of the croc, another lasso the tail end.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-62">The tail end is the trickier bit, because it tends to sit flat on the ground, leaving little room to slip the noose in. The crocodile can also flip its tail sideways in a flash, so that you can lose the lasso-hold that’s taken you ages to gain. The snout end has a bit more room between the lower jaw and the ground for the lasso to slide in.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-63">This lassoing process can take a long time. It certainly requires a lot of patience, not to mention nerves. Don’t forget, these men were not professionals, they were just my father’s fishery firm colleagues, and they only came to do it once a year, if that.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-64">The targeted crocodile has to be isolated. Chasing the rest of the crocodiles up onto the dry land, or away from the targeted one, can be tricky. With a dozen or so crocs in the one enclosure, as soon as you have managed to get some of them out of the pond, onto the dry land, and go back to the pond to chase more of them, the dry-land ones might return to the pond.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-65">Once the target has been isolated, the men will position the lassos, and with a lot of patience, time and nerves, slip them around the snout and up the tail.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-66">The rear lasso has to go as far up the tail as possible, best right up to the hind legs, as it’s the widest point, or it might slip off when you hoist the crocodile up and out of the enclosure. The tail also reflexively thrashes around as soon as the croc feels some movement at that end, so it might give the just-in lasso the slip even before it gets as far up as the hip.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-67">Once the lassos are in place, the two men will go “One, Two, Three, NOW!”, lift the crocodile out and, THUMP, straight onto the lawn.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-68">A third man drops a sack over the crocodile’s head, so that it cannot see what’s going on. He places his knee on the trunk of the crocodile, to pin it down to the ground. He then pulls its front legs over onto its back and ties them together.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-69">The front man tightens the lasso into a knot, thus clamping the crocodile’s jaws firmly shut. The one at the back pulls up the crocodile’s hind legs over onto its back, and ties them together.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-70">They then slip a stick under the ropes that tie up the front and hind legs, pick up the crocodile this way, and carry it to the waiting lorry.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-71">Being a girl and only ten years old, as well as having looked after the crocs since their babyhood, I found it very upsetting to witness them being trapped, tied up and carted off to be flayed. Even more so when, in the process of resisting capture, they would thrash around in the enclosure and end up bashing their snouts against the brick walls.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-72">Throughout the capturing process, I’d run around the men, urging them, “Be gentle! Be gentle! Don’t hurt them! Don’t hurt them!”</div>
<div class="para" id="p-73">They’d laugh at me, “Hahahaha, silly girl. Don’t hurt a crocodile, indeed! Wait till they bite you, or EAT you — you won’t be feeling so charitable then.”</div>
<div class="para" id="p-74">The sight of the overpowered crocodiles, lying there on the lawn with a bloody snout, helplessly trussed up with their legs held backwards over their back, never failed to sadden me to the core. Even to this day, 60 years later — more than the thought of them being skinned to become some wealthy and face-conscious man or woman’s fashion accessories.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-75">They might be crocodiles, but I’d looked after them since they were babies. The look of utter defeat and helplessness went straight to my heart every time. No pride or dignity left at all. So humiliating.</div>
